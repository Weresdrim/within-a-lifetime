    She breaks eye contact and faces the piano again. There's another several second gap where my guts bounce around inside my ribcage. I'm grateful when she breaks the silence.
    HAGAMI: "Mana must..."
    HAGAMI: "Is she alright?"
    TAKERU: "She's kind of upset. She thinks she let you down."
    HAGAMI: "..."
    TAKERU: "Hagami, I'm sorry, I didn't..."
    TAKERU: "I think it's me that let you down."
    TAKERU: "I pushed you to sign up for all this when you stopped with the paperwork, and I forced things through with Meiko, and even when you told me you weren't comfortable with performing, I - "
    HAGAMI: "No."
    TAKERU: "Er..."
    HAGAMI: "I owe you for that."
    TAKERU: "I don't get it. I think I've screwed it all up. I didn't listen when you were trying to back out of all of this, and I let slip to Mana you were going to perform, and..."
    TAKERU: "I guess I came down here to apologize. If it weren't for me, you wouldn't have had to be up there, and we'd be sitting with Mana and Meiko and everyone right now watching the fireworks."
    HAGAMI: "I'm glad I'm not."
    TAKERU: "You're... what?"
    HAGAMI: "I'm sick of it."
    HAGAMI: "Waiting, hiding, wishing I could be someone else."
    HAGAMI: "I... I don't want to be some mute all my life. A shadow hanging around the library."
    HAGAMI: "Takeru... What exactly do you think of me?"
    TAKERU: "Er..."
    TAKERU: "I guess, you're smart, you're obviously talented, and then, you've got your hangups, just like everyone else at Mirako, but..."
    HAGAMI: "I hate that."
    HAGAMI: "Pity. I don't want that. It's disgusting, and every minute I spend down here, hiding, I hate myself. Mana always cared about me even if I was useless, spending all my time running away from people instead of..."
    HAGAMI: "I don't want to be a shutin, Takeru. I want to be a world-class musician."
    TAKERU: "Er... Sorry. I'm sure you are, it's just..."
    HAGAMI: "You've never even heard me play."
    TAKERU: "No."
    HAGAMI: "That's why I hate. I absolutely hate it! If I can't even stand up there in front of you all and play, it doesn't matter. It's useless."
    TAKERU: "I don't think you're useless."
    HAGAMI: "..."
    TAKERU: "Er... I thought it was brave. I'm sorry, I haven't really thought this out, but even when you said you weren't feeling it, and you knew you'd probably not be able to do it, you got out there, so..."
    HAGAMI: "If I don't get the results, it doesn't matter."
    TAKERU: "I don't - "
    HAGAMI: "One second."
    She silences me and faces the piano.
    Her fingers are suspended over the keys. I'm reminded of her up on the stage, motionless for minutes, poised to begin playing, but this time, there's only a second to wait.
