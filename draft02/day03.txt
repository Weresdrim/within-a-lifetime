    In the morning, I'm exhausted.
    No, this couldn't be morning yet.
    THUMB.
    If it's not morning yet, why am I awake?
    Did that dream wake me up?
    THUMB.
    There it is again.
    A throbbing pain, right between my eyes.
    THUMB. THUMB.
    I must be running a fever of a million degrees for it to pulse like that.
    When I open my eyes I expect some dizziness or a bit of confusion, maybe, but nothing like the gray outline above me. A mountain of a person, index finger extended, heading straight for between my -
    I roll to the left and Kenta's finger barely misses my eyeball.
    TAKERU: "What the hell Kenta?"
    KENTA: "Good morning."
    TAKERU: "Yeah, just a fantastically good morning to you too. What do you think you're doing?"
    KENTA: "It's time to wake up."
    TAKERU: "So you just... jab me in the face?"
    KENTA: "You asked me yesterday to wake you up. Are you sleeptalking? Because you seem very confused about this."
    I'm forced to roll again as he takes aim at my bruised forehead.
    TAKERU: "I'm awake! I'm awake!"
    TAKERU: "Normal people usually wake each other up by like... Talking at them. Or shaking them."
    TAKERU: "I was kind of expecting that, and not, y'know, having the bridge of my nose pushed it."
    KENTA: "I tried calling your name but you just muttered at me and waved your arms a bit."
    TAKERU: "Oh..."
    TAKERU: "Wait, that's probably because..."
    I look out the window but there's not even a hint of light out.
    TAKERU: "Kenta, just how early did you get me up?"
    KENTA: "I've already gotten my first round of bids in so I figured you might want to do the same."
    TAKERU: "You figured I might want to..."
    KENTA: "Bidding in the early morning is a good strategy for auctions that close at odd hours. The PC is open downstairs if you like."
    TAKERU: "Kenta, it's ridiculously early, my head's killing me, and I don't even collect coins so why would I want to... bid on anything?"
    KENTA: "I certainly enjoy it so I assume you would."
    TAKERU: "Alright, this needs to happen sooner or later."
    I swing both my legs off the bed and sit up. Kenta stands there looking at me, genuinely puzzled.
    TAKERU: "Kenta, I don't want to be awake at 4am."
    TAKERU: "Not everyone is an exact clone of you. Not everyone shares your weird idiosyncracies or hobbies. I'm not your clone. Hell I'm not even your friend, I'm your roommate."
    KENTA: "I think it's pretty clear you're not my clone. We don't look similar, for one thing. Do people you meet often get confused about things like that?"
    TAKERU: "No, but normal people don't - "
    Maybe if I jab myself in the face I'll wake up in an hour or two and realize this was all just an extended nightmare.
    KENTA: "And of course it's hard to be a friend of someone if you don't share a hobby, which is why I suggest you start bidding this morning. I have some free time so I could point out a few basic strategies."
    TAKERU: "You... want me to pick up coin collecting because you think then we'll... what?"
