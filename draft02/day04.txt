label day04:

    My sixth sense tells me it's time to wake up.
    Not because of any particular time on the clock. Not because of any sort of sleep rhythm.
    I feel that if I lie here any longer, eyes closed, that I will be in mortal danger.
    Struggling to open my eyes, I see that danger: a shadow leaning over me.
    TAKERU: "Christ, Kenta, you don't need to lurk around like that."
    KENTA: "I was about to poke you to get you awake."
    TAKERU: "Then I was just in time."
    TAKERU: "...Although I probably need an alarm clock."
    I notice outside that the sun is up at least, that's a start.
    
    After an hour of navigating Kenta's elaborate sorting systems and doing nothing in the common room, followed by another arduous half hour of doing nothing outside of class, normal students start arriving at Mirako.
    There's no sign of Natsumi, but I guess she's always here late anyway. Instead, Meiko shows up.
    I knew this was coming, really, and this will just have to be something I deal with on a regular basis now... But Meiko arrives, and sits down next to me.
    If there was any hope I could blend in and just be another person here...
    MEIKO: "Good morning, Takeru. It's good to see you."
    TAKERU: "Yeah. Good morning."
    MEIKO: "You've been here a while?"
    TAKERU: "Yeah Kenta rises at dawn. I don't have much choice."
    She laughs.
    MEIKO: "I thought I saw you earlier from the library."
    TAKERU: "You go to the library this early?"
    MEIKO: "Haha, not always. There's a study group tonight so I need to brush up. I wouldn't want to unable to answer anyone's questions."
    TAKERU: "Oh."
    MEIKO: "You've been here, let's see, how many days now? Three?"
    TAKERU: "About, yeah."
    MEIKO: "Hopefully you'll get into the swing of things soon."
    Is it that obvious I'm uncomfortable? I try to laugh along with her but she has some air of assuredness I just can't imitate.
    It's not long before other of my classmates start dropping by to talk to her - some to ask for help with English, one with forms for the festival committee, another girl speaking only in whispers before leaving.
    I catch Hagami entering, wearing headphones. It's strange, I never seem to notice her around. She's just... always tuned out.
    There's one person that I can't place though. Mostly because it seems so out of character that it can't be that...
    TAKERU: "Hikari? You're in my class?"
    She's seated a place or two behind me.
    I receive only a scowl in return, and before I can press the issue, there's someone in the way.
    Natsumi.
    NATSUMI: "Hey! 'Morning, Takeru. Hey Meiko."
    NATSUMI: "It just wasn't morning without you. We were lost without our dear leader in homeroom."
    MEIKO: "Oh please."
    NATSUMI: "Kunida just doesn't have the charm."
    MEIKO: "I guess I'd better say my bit while he's still getting set up then."
    I could almost still be dreaming. My old acquaintance Meiko walks to the front of the room and in only a few seconds she has the attention of the room.
    MEIKO: "Welcome, all. Hope you're having a good morning and I missed you all while I was traveling."
    MEIKO: "With the festival coming up, there's only a few more days to get your applications in if you want to contribute as a club, and budget requests close a week after..."
    It really doesn't matter what she's saying, but that it's her saying it.
    Did Meiko ever take the iniative and talk to anyone? I can't remember her talking to multiple people at once without clamming up or running off.
    She wasn't...
    It seems odd to remember all of this about someone that was barely anything to me before my year at Tohoku and my year at the feeder school before that when I left that it seems strange I even knew her name or face.
    At risk of drifting off somewhere before class has even fully begun I should stop paying attention to things like this or probing what I remember.
    I don't remember much, actually.
    Meiko is taking her seat again.
    NATSUMI: "I can't belive it's coming up that fast."
    MEIKO: "It's always nice to have the festival in the summer. It's a good beacon for the beginning of the year."
    MEIKO: "You're looking forward to it, Takeru?"
    TAKERU: "To what?"
    NATSUMI: "The festival, you dumbbell. It's only what everyone's been talking about for the past two weeks."
    TAKERU: "I've been here two days, fill me in."
    NATSUMI: "Okay, so you know a summer festival right? And those school culture days everyone's got? Oh and also how small towns always seem to have these little - "
    TAKERU: "What?"
    NATSUMI: "Yeah, well take the best of those and you've got the Mirako School Exposition and Festival."
    MEIKO: "It's an open-house sort of event. We have food, performances, basically show what Mirako is, who we are, and we that care about the community."
    NATSUMI: "Yeah and there are always fireworks at the end, that's the best part."
    MEIKO: "The fireworks are off this year."
    NATSUMI: "Aw wait what? Really?"
    MEIKO: "Staff orders."
    NATSUMI: "That's a ripoff. How's Takeru going to see what the real Mirako festival looks like?"
    TAKERU: "So it's not real if there aren't fireworks? I don't get it."
    NATSUMI: "Ahhh, well that's the story of the fireworks. You've heard of that, haven't you? Mirako school legend."
    TAKERU: "I think it's pretty obvious I haven't."
    NATSUMI: "Under the stars, watching the night, the romance of the early summer, as the cherry blossoms fade..."
    NATSUMI: "Under that first burst in the air, you're sure to find true love."
    I squint at Natsumi.
    She responds by winking at me.
    MEIKO: "That's, uhm. Not quite what the festival is about."
    NATSUMI: "Sure it is, ask anyone."
    TAKERU: "Too bad they're canceled this year then if - "
    NATSUMI: "Shh! Kunida's started already."
    TAKERU: "He started like two minutes ago while you were going on about romantic summers under - "
    NATSUMI: "Shhhhhhh!"
    MEIKO: "Quiet down both of you."
    
    I hang around for a few minutes before lunch.
    Natsumi's obnoxious teammates show up, more students come to conference with Meiko before she slips out, Hagami leaves without a word to anyone with her headphones on (did she ever take them off?)
    But there's no sign of Hikari. It's like she up and left in the middle of the class. Did I really zone out that much?
    That doesn't matter, really. I have something to do with my break again today anyway.
    With the vandalized map now where it belongs in the trach can in my dorm, I rely on memory to find first the old wing, then the stairs to the odd little room Mana was turning into her own headquarters.
    Headquarters? Library? Clubroom? Something cross?
    TAKERU: "Yeah I shouldn't get involved."
    The door is shut. When I knock, there's no answer.
    All I really need to is to get that chess set back for Hikari, and then I can be on my way.
    Would it really be so bad if I just went in and took it?
    I mean, this room is public space, right? And nothing in there really belongs to the supernatural club, it's just junk that Hagami and probably mostly Mana hauled in from the basement.
    The door opens inwards with just the faintest creak. I don't know where the lights are but the place is well-lit by the sunlight through the out-of-place picture window.
    The chess set is easy to find as it's more of a chess box, and it sticks out on its shelve of clutter. The puzzle book is less obvious. Maybe I'll just have to ask Hagami for it before class some time.
    I'm almost at the door when I hear it.
    A voice?
    In that one moment hesitation to identify the speaker, I'd already made my fatal mistake.
    The library door swings open, and with my arms full of chess set, I can't defend myself and I fall.
    I fall in what seems like slow motion, towards the table, the last thing I see a stunned Mana standing over me.
    
    If I'd died right then it would've been a pretty fitting capstone on my life.
    Short, nonsensical, probably funny to someone but definitely not to me.
    If I'd died right then I'd also be spared the splitting headache that comes with waking up.
    When I win the struggle to open my eyes, I'm lying under the library window.
    Bu... there's someone's face above mine. Hagami?
    She startles, enough to make me jump as well. Or jump as much as I can because I can't seem to get off the floor, like I'm covered in a net.
    TAKERU: "What..."
    It's not a net, per se, just the world's heaviest and ugliest quilt.
    As I struggle to throw the repulsive object off me and stand up, Hagami backs up and into a chair.
    TAKERU: "Ow..."
    TAKERU: "Where's Mana?"
    HAGAMI: "..."
    TAKERU: "I asked if you knew where Mana went. She floored me again and then ran off?"
    HAGAMI: "...An accident. 
    HAGAMI: "Was it..."
    HAGAMI: "She said it was accidental. Is that wrong?"
    TAKERU: "I don't really care, she just has a talent for concussing me is all."
    I sit opposite Hagami, head throbbing to much to stand.
    HAGAMI: "You're alright?"
    TAKERU: "For the time being. At what point were you going to get the nurse?"
    HAGAMI: "..."
    TAKERU: "And Mana went... where?"
    HAGAMI: "I think... to get help?"
    TAKERU: "How long ago was that?"
    Hagami shrugs.
    TAKERU: "Great, so it was a hit and run, perfect. She aims to kill and then leaves you to watch over me to make sure the mortal blow was clean."
    HAGAMI: "It... I wanted to make sure you were alright."
    HAGAMI: "Just wasn't sure how to help."
    The whole time, she won't look at me. Or rather, she won't look up from another hardcover, an ancient-looking book that if she wanted to, she could effectively hide behind.
    It's now that she draws fully behind it.
    HAGAMI: "I'm sorry."
    TAKERU: "I'm not really that angry, my head just hurts. A hand would be nice though."
    I'm looking at all the chess pieces scattered on the floor. The little green and orange miniatures that had once been packed and ordered inside the box seem to have made their way to every corner of the library.
    HAGAMI: "Oh."
    HAGAMI: "Is that..."
    We start fishing up the pieces around the table.
    It takes a few minutes to scrounge up some of the pawns that rolled under the shelf, but we eventually have a full set.
    Well, almost a full set. I recheck all the corners of the library, but there's finding one of the knights.
    TAKERU: "There's no finding it. Guess we'll have to call it a loss."
    HAGAMI: "..."
    TAKERU: "I'm taking this back, by the way."
    TAKERU: "Mana got the chess set for you, but, it already has an owner. Sorry if you were interested."
    HAGAMI: "I really wasn't."
    HAGAMI: "That's just... a hypothetical."
    HAGAMI: "Something I told her would be more appealing than a supernatural club but she..."
    HAGAMI: "Mana can sometimes take things very literally or jump on the littlest things."
    HAGAMI: "She really just wanted to start a club, that I'd show up to, and it didn't matter what the club actually did."
    HAGAMI: "I suggested chess, a literature club, a..."
    HAGAMI: "Now there's... supernatural club."
    It's fast but I swear Hagami rolls her eyes.
    HAGAMI: "Ah. I'm really sorry."
    TAKERU: "What are you apologizing for?"
    Hagami doesn't respond though... just vanishes behind her book.
    I'm left sitting here, staring at the cover. It's titled 'Post-Hume Metaphysics: A Brief Summary.'
    TAKERU: "That hardly looks brief."
    HAGAMI: "..."
    So much for humor. Then again she seems about as humorless as Kenta. Surprising they don't get along.
    It's not a bad room to eat in, really. This time of day, the sun through the picture window is enough to see (and read) by without turning on the lights.
    That said... I'm here with one of the world's worst conversationalists, and I'm pretty much obligated to wait for Mana if she really went to get help.
    I'm beginning to think she never really intended to come back at all. Or else got distracted on the way tot he nurse or something. That's probably more likely.
    Something keeps buzzing in my ear.
    Or it's more static than a buzz. Is that old radio on? I fight with a knob, trying to get it to turn off, but it's a mystery to me how this thing works. It's as much of an antique as the rest of this room.
    In response to my fiddling, a hand shoots out from behind Post-Hume Metaphysics and turns a dial on the side. The volume turns up. It's... a symphony?
    Listening to scratchy old music isn't helping the time pass any faster.
    Out of boredom I flip through the magazines and looseleaf littering the table.
    There's a whole volume of that weird manga Mana was reading strewn around. Most of the covers are illustrated with flower-looking boys and the thing is titled "My Rose-colored Life (even though I'm already dead!!)"
    While I'm pretty sure I know what this is about, I open one at random. Yep, this page is some sort of girls' manga first kiss scene, except the couple involved have ghost tails instead of legs.
    After a second I realize... I'm being watched.
    HAGAMI: "..."
    TAKERU: "Hey I just opened it because it was here, I don't read this stuff."
    HAGAMI: "..."
    TAKERU: "You have any suggestions instead?"
    I thought my tone made it clear I was joking, but Hagami sets down her tome (with accompanying dust cloud) and marches to the bookshelves.
    There's no way there's anything I'd be interested in reading exists on those shelves. In fact I can't think of anything I'd want to read for pleasure anyway, let alone that mess of abandoned textbooks and whatever Mana managed to steal from unsuspecting students.
    WHUMP.
    HAGAMI: "There."
    I almost jump out of my chair when Hagami puts down this... brick in front of me.
    At first I think it's a dictionary, but it's... "Post-Hume Metaphysics: A Briefer Summary."
    TAKERU: "I, er..."
    HAGAMI: "...Read it."
    This has to be a joke, right? But the way Hagami is staring at me...
    She can't be serious.
    I open the front cover but can't help but cringe. I'd be lying if I said I knew half of these words. And this is the table of contents.
    TAKERU: "Er, when I said I wanted suggestions, I sort of meant..."
    TAKERU: "Are you laughing at me?"
    HAGAMI: "!"
    She hides behind the Brief Summary again but I saw her snickering.
    So she does have a sense of humor... just one where I'm the butt of the joke.
    TAKERU: "Personally I don't find that very funny."
    HAGAMI: "Time for class."
    TAKERU: "What? Seriously? By my watch there's still at least then minutes until..."
    Hagami starts sweeping her part of the table into her bag. I notice she's blushing for whatever reason.
    But before she can open the door, Mana skids in.
    MANA: "Hagami! Where are you going? Look, I've got the club charter forms! And the club festival application forms! We're doing this!"
    MANA: "Oh hi Takeru!"
    MANA: "Wait oh Takeru I'm so sorry I went to get the nurse but then I ran into Yumi and she said the festival deadline was coming up and I went back to homeroom to grab my - "
    MANA: "I totally forgot!"
    TAKERU: "About knocking me out cold?"
    MANA: "Yeah! I forgot about that."
    TAKERU: "Wish I could forget about this headache..."
    MANA: "But Hagami took good care of you right. Hagami where are you going?"
    Guess she won't manage to sneak out after trying to trick me into reading that metaphysics thing.
    HAGAMI: "Oh. Yeah."
    MANA: "But yeah we're an official club now! Once we get another member, I mean. We need four."
    MANA: "You, me, and Takeru aren't quite enough."
    TAKERU: "Hang on, when did I get roped into this?"
    Mana and Hagami look at each other.
    HAGAMI: "It really is time for class though."
    MANA: "No way! I haven't even eaten!"
    She takes off the opposite direction. I stare down the hall as she takes a corner too fast and almost trips.
    HAGAMI: "...Figured."
    Hagami shakes her head and starts walking.
    But of course, I'm headed the same direction. We're in the same class after all. Though the whole time, she doesn't say a word. And without any book to hide in, she just stares straight ahead, as if I wasn't walking there two steps behind her.
    She fumbles with her bookbag for a moment, and reemerges wearing those headphones.
    I guess now it's less awkward for her to pretend that I don't exist.
    
    At least there's some normalcy when we get back to the classroom. Kenta and Natsumi are bickering outside, with Kenta only stopping from his argument to glare dagger at Hagami as she slips into the room. I'm less successful.
    NATSUMI: "Takeru! Yeah hey, Takeru!"
    TAKERU: "Huh?"
    NATSUMI: "Kenta's not studying for Kunida's test! Can you believe it?"
    KENTA: "I'm not in his class. It makes no sense."
    NATSUMI: "Because I'm studying for it! You've gotta help me."
    KENTA: "I can't help you if I'm not in the class. That's just how it works. This shouldn't be so hard to understand."
    NATSUMI: "Fiiine, Takeru will help me then."
    TAKERU: "It's not like I know more than you."
    NATSUMI: "Great fit then. See you at the study session this afternoon? The one Meiko's putting together?"
    TAKERU: "I guess I've already been goaded into going anyway."
    NATSUMI: "Perfect. Kenta, you've been replaced!"
    KENTA: "That's not what 'replaced' means. You can't replace me if I was never - "
    I ignore them and take my seat.
    Meiko doesn't seem to be back yet.
