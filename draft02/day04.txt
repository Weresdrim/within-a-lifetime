label day04:

    My sixth sense tells me it's time to wake up.
    Not because of any particular time on the clock. Not because of any sort of sleep rhythm.
    I feel that if I lie here any longer, eyes closed, that I will be in mortal danger.
    Struggling to open my eyes, I see that danger: a shadow leaning over me.
    TAKERU: "Christ, Kenta, you don't need to lurk around like that."
    KENTA: "I was about to poke you to get you awake."
    TAKERU: "Then I was just in time."
    TAKERU: "...Although I probably need an alarm clock."
    I notice outside that the sun is up at least, that's a start.
