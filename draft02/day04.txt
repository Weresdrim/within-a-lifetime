label day04:

    My sixth sense tells me it's time to wake up.
    Not because of any particular time on the clock. Not because of any sort of sleep rhythm.
    I feel that if I lie here any longer, eyes closed, that I will be in mortal danger.
    Struggling to open my eyes, I see that danger: a shadow leaning over me.
    TAKERU: "Christ, Kenta, you don't need to lurk around like that."
    KENTA: "I was about to poke you to get you awake."
    TAKERU: "Then I was just in time."
    TAKERU: "...Although I probably need an alarm clock."
    I notice outside that the sun is up at least, that's a start.
    
    After an hour of navigating Kenta's elaborate sorting systems and doing nothing in the common room, followed by another arduous half hour of doing nothing outside of class, normal students start arriving at Mirako.
    There's no sign of Natsumi, but I guess she's always here late anyway. Instead, Meiko shows up.
    I knew this was coming, really, and this will just have to be something I deal with on a regular basis now... But Meiko arrives, and sits down next to me.
    If there was any hope I could blend in and just be another person here...
    MEIKO: "Good morning, Takeru. It's good to see you."
    TAKERU: "Yeah. Good morning."
    MEIKO: "You've been here a while?"
    TAKERU: "Yeah Kenta rises at dawn. I don't have much choice."
    She laughs.
    MEIKO: "I thought I saw you earlier from the library."
    TAKERU: "You go to the library this early?"
    MEIKO: "Haha, not always. There's a study group tonight so I need to brush up. I wouldn't want to unable to answer anyone's questions."
    TAKERU: "Oh."
    MEIKO: "You've been here, let's see, how many days now? Three?"
    TAKERU: "About, yeah."
    MEIKO: "Hopefully you'll get into the swing of things soon."
    Is it that obvious I'm uncomfortable? I try to laugh along with her but she has some air of assuredness I just can't imitate.
    It's not long before other of my classmates start dropping by to talk to her - some to ask for help with English, one with forms for the festival committee, another girl speaking only in whispers before leaving.
    I catch Hagami entering, wearing headphones. It's strange, I never seem to notice her around. She's just... always tuned out.
    There's one person that I can't place though. Mostly because it seems so out of character that it can't be that...
    TAKERU: "Hikari? You're in my class?"
    She's seated a place or two behind me.
    I receive only a scowl in return, and before I can press the issue, there's someone in the way.
    Natsumi.
    NATSUMI: "Hey! 'Morning, Takeru. Hey Meiko."
    NATSUMI: "It just wasn't morning without you. We were lost without our dear leader in homeroom."
    MEIKO: "Oh please."
    NATSUMI: "Kunida just doesn't have the charm."
    MEIKO: "I guess I'd better say my bit while he's still getting set up then."
    I could almost still be dreaming. My old acquaintance Meiko walks to the front of the room and in only a few seconds she has the attention of the room.
    MEIKO: "Welcome, all. Hope you're having a good morning and I missed you all while I was traveling."
    MEIKO: "With the festival coming up, there's only a few more days to get your applications in if you want to contribute as a club, and budget requests close a week after..."
    It really doesn't matter what she's saying, but that it's her saying it.
    Did Meiko ever take the iniative and talk to anyone? I can't remember her talking to multiple people at once without clamming up or running off.
    She wasn't...
    It seems odd to remember all of this about someone that was barely anything to me before my year at Tohoku and my year at the feeder school before that when I left that it seems strange I even knew her name or face.
    At risk of drifting off somewhere before class has even fully begun I should stop paying attention to things like this or probing what I remember.
    I don't remember much, actually.
    Meiko is taking her seat again.
    NATSUMI: "I can't belive it's coming up that fast."
    MEIKO: "It's always nice to have the festival in the summer. It's a good beacon for the beginning of the year."
    MEIKO: "You're looking forward to it, Takeru?"
    TAKERU: "To what?"
    NATSUMI: "The festival, you dumbbell. It's only what everyone's been talking about for the past two weeks."
    TAKERU: "I've been here two days, fill me in."
    NATSUMI: "Okay, so you know a summer festival right? And those school culture days everyone's got? Oh and also how small towns always seem to have these little - "
    TAKERU: "What?"
    NATSUMI: "Yeah, well take the best of those and you've got the Mirako School Exposition and Festival."
    MEIKO: "It's an open-house sort of event. We have food, performances, basically show what Mirako is, who we are, and we that care about the community."
    NATSUMI: "Yeah and there are always fireworks at the end, that's the best part."
    MEIKO: "The fireworks are off this year."
    NATSUMI: "Aw wait what? Really?"
    MEIKO: "Staff orders."
    NATSUMI: "That's a ripoff. How's Takeru going to see what the real Mirako festival looks like?"
    TAKERU: "So it's not real if there aren't fireworks? I don't get it."
    NATSUMI: "Ahhh, well that's the story of the fireworks. You've heard of that, haven't you? Mirako school legend."
    TAKERU: "I think it's pretty obvious I haven't."
    NATSUMI: "Under the stars, watching the night, the romance of the early summer, as the cherry blossoms fade..."
    NATSUMI: "Under that first burst in the air, you're sure to find true love."
    I squint at Natsumi.
    She responds by winking at me.
    MEIKO: "That's, uhm. Not quite what the festival is about."
    NATSUMI: "Sure it is, ask anyone."
    TAKERU: "Too bad they're canceled this year then if - "
    NATSUMI: "Shh! Kunida's started already."
    TAKERU: "He started like two minutes ago while you were going on about romantic summers under - "
    NATSUMI: "Shhhhhhh!"
    MEIKO: "Quiet down both of you."
    
    I hang around for a few minutes before lunch.
    Natsumi's obnoxious teammates show up, more students come to conference with Meiko before she slips out, Hagami leaves without a word to anyone with her headphones on (did she ever take them off?)
    But there's no sign of Hikari. It's like she up and left in the middle of the class. Did I really zone out that much?
    That doesn't matter, really. I have something to do with my break again today anyway.
    With the vandalized map now where it belongs in the trach can in my dorm, I rely on memory to find first the old wing, then the stairs to the odd little room Mana was turning into her own headquarters.
    Headquarters? Library? Clubroom? Something cross?
    TAKERU: "Yeah I shouldn't get involved."
    The door is shut. When I knock, there's no answer.
    All I really need to is to get that chess set back for Hikari, and then I can be on my way.
    Would it really be so bad if I just went in and took it?
    I mean, this room is public space, right? And nothing in there really belongs to the supernatural club, it's just junk that Hagami and probably mostly Mana hauled in from the basement.
    The door opens inwards with just the faintest creak. I don't know where the lights are but the place is well-lit by the sunlight through the out-of-place picture window.
    The chess set is easy to find as it's more of a chess box, and it sticks out on its shelve of clutter. The puzzle book is less obvious. Maybe I'll just have to ask Hagami for it before class some time.
    I'm almost at the door when I hear it.
    A voice?
    In that one moment hesitation to identify the speaker, I'd already made my fatal mistake.
    The library door swings open, and with my arms full of chess set, I can't defend myself and I fall.
    I fall in what seems like slow motion, towards the table, the last thing I see a stunned Mana standing over me.
    
    If I'd died right then it would've been a pretty fitting capstone on my life.
    Short, nonsensical, probably funny to someone but definitely not to me.
    If I'd died right then I'd also be spared the splitting headache that comes with waking up.
    When I win the struggle to open my eyes, I'm lying under the library window.
    Bu... there's someone's face above mine. Hagami?
    She startles, enough to make me jump as well. Or jump as much as I can because I can't seem to get off the floor, like I'm covered in a net.
    TAKERU: "What..."
    It's not a net, per se, just the world's heaviest and ugliest quilt.
    As I struggle to throw the repulsive object off me and stand up, Hagami backs up and into a chair.
    TAKERU: "Ow..."
    TAKERU: "Where's Mana?"
    HAGAMI: "..."
    TAKERU: "I asked if you knew where Mana went. She floored me again and then ran off?"
    HAGAMI: "...An accident. Was it..."
    HAGAMI: "She said it was accidental. Is that wrong?"
    TAKERU: "I don't really care, she just has a talent for concussing me is all."
    I sit opposite Hagami, head throbbing to much to stand.
    HAGAMI: "You're alright?"
    TAKERU: "For the time being. At what point were you going to get the nurse?"
    HAGAMI: "..."
    TAKERU: "And Mana went... where?"
    HAGAMI: "Her club."
    HAGAMI: "They have lunch, sometimes."
    TAKERU: "Great, a hit and run, perfect. She aims to kill and then leaves you to watch over me to make sure the mortal blow was clean."
    HAGAMI: "It... I wanted to make sure you were alright."
    HAGAMI: "Just wasn't sure how to help."
    The whole time, she won't look at me. Or rather, she won't look up from another hardcover, an ancient-looking book that if she wanted to, she could effectively hide behind.
    It's now that she draws fully behind it.
    HAGAMI: "I'm sorry."
    TAKERU: "I'm not really that angry, my head just hurts. Some help would be nice though."
    I'm looking at all the chess pieces scattered on the floor. The little green and orange miniatures that had once been packed and ordered inside the box seem to have made their way to every corner of the library.
    HAGAMI: "Oh."
    HAGAMI: "Is that..."
    We start fishing up the pieces around the table.
    TAKERU: "Yeah Mana got the chess set for you, but, even if you're interesting, it already has an owner."
    HAGAMI: "I'm not interested."
    HAGAMI: "That's just... a hypothetical."
    HAGAMI: "Something I told her would be more appealing than a supernatural club but she..."
    HAGAMI: "Mana can sometimes take things very literally or jump on the littlest things."
    HAGAMI: "She really just wanted to start a club, that I'd show up to, and it didn't matter what the club actually did."
    HAGAMI: "Sorry."
    TAKERU: "What're you apologizing for?"
