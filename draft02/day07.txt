day07:
    
    At least today I have the pleasure of sleeping in.
    I can sleep past dawn, free of Kenta.
    Free... of Kenta?
    I wake up. Yep, no sign of him.
    It's well past dawn, too. That's a first, and it's great and all, but...
    TAKERU: "How late did I sleep? What did I miss?"
    Compared to our room's usual spotless appearance, something is subtly... wrong.
    A few empty one-liter bottles lie by the door. A few cardboard boxes sit in a pile by the corner. Something smells sweet, almost sickly.
    Oh and the dressers are entirely missing.
    While Kenta did say it was embalming day, and I understand that he probably took them outside rather than unleash some chemical weapon in my dorm room...
    TAKERU: "My clothes were in there too... Not just your idiot spiders."
    TAKERU: "Dammit."
    At least I don't have anywhere to be until after lunch, and if I don't make it the so-called ghost hunt, I can just study here rather than up at the old library.
    There's a voice outside the door.
    Kenta must be back, good timing.
    TAKERU: "Hey Kenta, thanks for not gassing me in my sleep but if next time you could leave like some pants for me or something that'd - "
    NATSUMI: "Oh, 'morning Takeru. Did you just roll out of bed? Finally ready to help me and Kenta with the - "
    TAKERU: "Nope. Goodbye."
    I slam the door.
    TAKERU: "I don't care how late it is, this is still too early for... that."
    Repeat after me: they are not actually intentionally out to get you. Kenta and Natsumi are just trying to be friendly, but they suck at it. They're aren't intentionally trying to make your life painful.
    No use. I can't convince myself. Hell is other people.
    There's a knock on the door.
    NATSUMI: "Hey! I only came up to drop off all this laundry!"
    TAKERU: "You... what?"
    NATSUMI: "Yeah, Kenta and the team are brewing up a storm out there so I figured I'd rescue your clothes. You can thank me later!"
    The footsteps vanish.
    When I open the door again, the pile of tangled shirts and inside-out socks almost makes me wish Kenta's personal laundry service. Except all of this reeks of chemicals.
    TAKERU: "Wonderful."
    Just once I want a day off around here.
    
    About an hour later, I head downstairs.
    Whatever is going on outside is leaking. I can smell it, I swear. There are only dozen or so people in the common room, eating a late breakfast or early lunch. Everyone must be outside escaping that chemical odor.
    Or maybe just enjoying the day.
    It's bright out. I immediately spot Kenta and Natsumi around the side of the building, mostly because they've got two dorm dressers out on the lawn, along with a few plastic paint buckets, probably the source of that reek.
    TAKERU: "Hey Kenta, Natsumi. How'd you two even get those down here?"
    KENTA: "Good morning. You're talking about the dressers?"
    TAKERU: "What else?"
    NATSUMI: "I brought a few helping hands."
    Kenta and Natsumi aren't the only ones laboring over the buckets. A couple of guys I recognize from class are wandering around.
    The baseball team? Do they always follow Natsumi around or something?
    KENTA: "If you'd like to help, there's still another mixing phase left to figure out."
    TAKERU: "Sorry, I have er, other plans."
    Before I turn to go - 
    TAKERU: "Just make sure those dressers make it back up to our room, okay?"
    KENTA: "Obviously."
    NATSUMI: "Oh yeah, no need to thank me for your clothes, Takeru!"
    A few of the guys in baseball hats chuckle behind me.
    I don't really think where I'm walking.
    It's odd for me now to see "baseball team member" as shorthand for "Natsumi's sycophant" vs "my sycophant." Maybe that's why I can't bear them.
    Just have to remember... Natsumi and Kenta are just well-meaning idiots. I hope.
    Well, throw me, a normal idiot into the mix and the whole balance is off.
    TAKERU: "Screw it, who am I kidding... it's not like everyone's life revolves around me anyway."
    Still I don't especially want to hang around the common room today. I grab a quick lunch then set out for nowhere in particular.  
    Shizukawa isn't exactly a happening place.
    What do people even do up here, halfway up a mountainside? Farm? It's not like any tourists would show up here.
    Whose bright idea was it to set up a boarding school in a town like this? Tohoku wasn't in a city either, but at least there I had practice to fill just about every empty minute so it wasn't an issue.
    Now I'm just... aimless.
    It's nowhere near when I'm supposed to meet Mana and Hagami at Mirako, but I start heading in that direction anyway. I can use the spare time to go through all those forms Meiko gave me.
    
    I haven't seen Mirako this empty since the day I arrived a week ago.
    This probably isn't the sort of place where even the serious clubs meet on the off days. Even the picnic tables out front are empty.
    Still though... With its archaic, sprawling look, to anyone passing by, it must look abandoned.
    Abandoned, and even in the daylight... slightly haunted?
    TAKERU: "Don't be stupid, Takeru."
    If I manage to psych myself out in broad daylight, it doesn't bode well for tonight.
    Walking up to the front door...
    It doesn't open.
    This makes perfect sense, but it also reinforce the fact that I am an idiot.
    I might as well work outside.
    The stack of papers entrusted to me by Meiko are all club submissions for one thing or another. Mostly budget requests? Looks like there are a few forms here for new clubs
