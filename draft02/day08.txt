label day08:

    Maybe I'm finally getting used to the Kenta schedule.
    I'm up way earlier than necessary, and on the road to Mirako way earlier than necessary.
    Next to me, Kenta is telling me more about spiders than is at all necessary.
    KENTA: "...but because of the vacuum seal on the delivery packages, prices can be unreasonable."
    TAKERU: "Uh huh."
    KENTA: "My first shipment I wasn't as lucky, but I think the per-specimen cost on this most recent batch was closer to 8000 yen."
    TAKERU: "Uh huh."
    TAKERU: "Wait, you're paying how much for a spider?"
    KENTA: "They're arthropods. Different taxon."
    TAKERU: "How much per arthropod?"
    KENTA: "On average, 8,000 yen."
    TAKERU: "How on earth do you afford all that? Is your family loaded or something?"
    That'd make sense. They shipped Kenta off here and then gave him a budget to shut him up.
    KENTA: "Well I sold the coins for about 200,000. So that's maybe 20% profit but I'd have to be looking at the spreadsheet to get you exact numbers."
    TAKERU: "You actually make money off this stuff?"
    KENTA: "Given the time invested in auction sites I wouldn't call it much of a return."
    KENTA: "And you have to keep careful track of everything."
    TAKERU: "Maybe Meiko should've contracted this festival junk out to you instead..."
    KENTA: "Festival junk?"
    We're on the Shizukawa bridge now.
    I pause to pull the notebook and assorted forms out of my bookbag.
    TAKERU: "Yeah. Look at this stuff."
    KENTA: "You're joining the student council?"
    TAKERU: "No? Meiko's a friend of mine, she's apparently in charge of the festival committee. Somehow I volunteered to handle some of this."
    TAKERU: "Speaking of which... Do you know where I can find Mitani Mitsuo?"
    KENTA: "Who?"
    TAKERU: "He's president of the math club."
    KENTA: "No. Why?"
    TAKERU: "You'd think he'd be able to add up a bunch of numbers correctly but he totally screwed up this budget form. I need to find him and make him redo it."
    TAKERU: "How about... Ito Naoji?"
    KENTA: "Never heard of him."
    TAKERU: "According to this he's in you're class. Come on..."
    TAKERU: "Okay, you ever meet a Haruki Natsumi?"
    KENTA: "No. Sorry."
    TAKERU: "That was a trick question. You argue with Natsumi outside my classroom like every day!"
    KENTA: "That doesn't mean I should pay her any attention."
    TAKERU: "And she was the one helping you dunk all those spiders in formaldehyde yesterday! Come on Kenta, you have to pay more attention to other people."
    KENTA: "Things like names aren't important to me. If her name's Natsumi, then fine. I appreciate her for helping me out and occassionally changing her opinions to better ones."
    TAKERU: "But other people sure care if you remember their names. It makes it seem like you don't care about them."
    KENTA: "I don't follow."
    TAKERU: "Like... Where is your tie right now? Your shirt's inside-out again too."
    KENTA: "Is that important?"
    TAKERU: "It sure makes it seem like you're lazy. Or that you're some delinquent that doesn't care about Mirako or its rules."
    KENTA: "I don't mind if other people think I'm lazy. I do like our school. Its rules I don't really care about."
    KENTA: "I guess you do if you're going through all of those papers. Unless the details work has to do with arthropods, I don't care about it. What you have there seems very dull."
    TAKERU: "No kidding it's dull."
    TAKERU: "I'm just doing it as a favor to my friend though."
    KENTA: "Yes, it's very odd that you'd go through all that trouble when you've never even been to Mirako's festival before."
    TAKERU: "True enough..."
    TAKERU: "What's it like?"
    KENTA: "I'm not sure."
    TAKERU: "Weren't you here for last year?"
    KENTA: "Yes but I'm not sure it was a normal festival as there was quite a commotion. The accident might've changed how things work. That thing burned down."
    TAKERU: "Hang on... 'That' thing?"
    KENTA: "The boathouse. You can be very thick sometimes but you do see that, don't you?"
    He's pointing at the ruin.
    TAKERU: "That burned at the festival last year?"
    KENTA: "That's what I just said. You can be very thick some - "
    I ignore Kenta.
    For some reason the ruin has always seemed just like that... A 'ruin.' Imagining it not burned down out there is screwing with me. Seems like it's been standing there deserted for decades.
    TAKERU: "What happened?"
    KENTA: "It burned down."
    TAKERU: "Yeah, but... how? Why?"
    KENTA: "Presumably it caught fire."
    TAKERU: "Never mind. I'll ask Meiko or someone."
    KENTA: "Who?"
    TAKERU: "I'll also ask her where I should go to find all these people for the paperwork because it's pretty obvious you're not going to be helpful there."
    KENTA: "I'm a helpful person. Try me."
    We walk up the hill to Mirako, but of course Kenta can't place a single one of the names I give him.
    Yeah, maybe Kenta's helpful, in a roundabout way.
    I can't think too deeply about it though, too much to do today. Getting distracted by that charred building on the river won't help.
    
    I manage to track down two or three people on my list before it's time for homeroom, mostly by asking random upperclassmen if they know who so-and-so.
    Most of these people are a year ahead of me, but I guess that figures, if they're in charge of clubs.
    You'd never think there were this many student groups at Mirako, given the sleepiness of the towns. There are a surprising amount of students here.
    ...And it seems like everyone's involved. Unlike Tohoku. We only had sports teams, basically.
    Or maybe I just didn't see beyond my own immediate surroundings.
    Regardless, I arrive at class with a few minutes to go. A few of my classmates are milling around chatting, and Meiko has her desk covered in papers, as usual.
    TAKERU: "Hey. Busy with festival stuff?"
    MEIKO: "Hi Takeru, good morning. Of course. I'll probably have my hands full for this whole month."
    MEIKO: "How are things going on your end?"
    TAKERU: "Found a few people this morning. But still a lot to go. Everyone's terrible at filling out these forms, apparently."
    MEIKO: "Ah, haha, well I'm glad you're making progress, but I meant to ask if you enjoyed your day off. I didn't see you around."
    TAKERU: "Oh."
    TAKERU: "I guess so."
    TAKERU: "Did you know Mirako has a basement below the basement?"
    MEIKO: "Hm, I guess no I didn't. What does that have to do with your day off?"
    TAKERU: "Oh, nothing. I just met up with my club is all."
    I instantly regret mentioning the supernatural club and 'my' in the same sentence.
    MEIKO: "Ah, neat, so you've found a group you're interested in. Now I won't need to open up room on the festival committee. So did Natsumi finally convince you to join the baseball team?"
    TAKERU: "No, nothing like that. It's not really my club, really, I just sort of put my name down because they're short on members and one of the leaders is in my class, I don't really - "
    MEIKO: "Interesting. So you joined the supernatural club?"
    TAKERU: "Wait, hang on, how do you know that?"
    MEIKO: "That's the only club application I had to turn down for being short on members."
    MEIKO: "Good on you for helping them off the ground, though. I'm sure Hagami appreciates it."
    TAKERU: "You know her?"
    MEIKO "I know that she's in our class."
    We both look backwards at the same time. Hagami is there at her desk in the back row, sure, but her headphones are on.
    She doesn't notice us looking her way.
    MEIKO: "...As a transfer student, she must feel out of place, so I've reached out to her a bit, but..."
    TAKERU: "Didn't get much of a response?"
    MEIKO: "No..."
    TAKERU: "Sounds about right."
    MEIKO: "I guess it's impossible to please everyone, isn't it?"
    TAKERU: "Yeah. Too bad, Meiko, you'll have to settle for 95% of our class idolizing you instead of 100%."
    MEIKO: "Oh, haha, I'm sure it's nothing like that."
    NATSUMI: "Hii, good morning."
    NATSUMI: "Guess what?"
    TAKERU: "What?"
    NATSUMI: "I'm on time."
    TAKERU: "Am I supposed to be impressed?"
    MEIKO: "Ah! Then that means I'm running late!"
    NATSUMI: "Sheesh, good morning to you too."
    Meiko takes her spot in front of the class as the noise dies down.
    MEIKO: "Good morning everyone! Hope you're looking forward to another week at Mirako."
    MEIKO: "Don't forget we have a math test tomorrow. I'm hoping we can all - "
    MEIKO: "Yes, Natsumi?"
    NATSUMI: "That means there's study session tonight, yeah?"
    MEIKO: "Right. I'll be hosting in the library."
    There's some cheering, mostly from Natsumi.
    MEIKO: "And another reminder, the first round of club applications are due by the end of this week."
    MEIKO: "The student council will be considering budget requests for the festival until - "
    MEIKO: "Yes, Natsumi?"
    NATSUMI: "I heard the fireworks are back and better than ever, yeah?"
    MEIKO: "You must have heard wrong. Those are still canceled." 
    ...there's some grumbling, mostly from Natsumi.
    MEIKO: "But I'm sure we can come together as a school and enjoy..."
    Meiko continues but Natsumi is no longer interested.
    TAKERU: "Where'd you hear that from?"
    NATSUMI: "Oh, nobody, but I figure if I bug Meiko enough she'll eventually change her mind."
    MEIKO: "Change my mind about what?"
    NATSUMI: "You're back! Takeru was just saying he was going to change your mind about the fireworks now that he's on the festival planning committee."
    TAKERU: "I'm not - "
    MEIKO: "Sorry, that's straight from the staff. I'm on your side for this one, but we're just students. There's only so much influence we have."
    NATSUMI: "Hmmm..."
    NATSUMI: "Then I guess you'll have to get them to change their minds. That should be easy for the great Meiko."
    MEIKO: "Flattering me won't work either."
    NATSUMI: "Takeru, you'll at least promise me you'll get the principal and them to get the fireworks back."
    TAKERU: "I'm just Meiko's secretary but I'll pass your feelings along."
    NATSUMI: "Don't betray me like that. I thought we were on the same - "
    MEIKO: "Shh! Mr. Kunida's here."
    
    An hour of nothing. Then another, another --
    NATSUMI: "Hey Takeru..."
    TAKERU: "Yeah..."
    NATSUMI: "Did you get any of that?"
    TAKERU: "No not really."
    TAKERU: "We're doomed tomorrow, aren't we?"
    NATSUMI: "Definitely."
    NATSUMI: "I've got a deal for you."
    TAKERU: "Oh yeah?"
    NATSUMI: "You con Meiko into helping you, and I'll get Kenta to write up the answers for me. Divide and conquer."
    TAKERU: "Brilliant plan."
    MEIKO: "I don't know what you're signing me up for there but I don't like the sound of it."
    NATSUMI: "Go for it Takeru. It'll be easy for you to win her over."
    MEIKO: "You two just come to the study group tonight and you'll do fine, I promise."
    NATSUMI: "Thaaanks Meiko."
    I make a note not to pair with Natsumi again. It'd be embarassing to fail my first exam here.
    NATSUMI: "Hey Takeru, speaking of Kenta, I finally got him to agree to run our numbers for the tournament."
    NATSUMI: "Come have lunch with us. You can be the mediator while we hash out the deal."
    TAKERU: "So you were just trying to get in his good books by bringing the baseball around to help with the spiders, were you?"
    NATSUMI: "They're arthropods, not - "
    TAKERU: "Don't you start on me. I've got other plans anyway."
    NATSUMI: "Oh ho, eating with Meiko again?"
    MEIKO: "I need to check in with the student council. I'll see you all later."
    NATSUMI: "Hmmm..."
    She squints at me as I walk out the door.
    NATSUMI: "If you're secretly joining the swim team or something I'm going to be mad, you hear?"
    TAKERU: "Bye, Natsumi."
