label day08:

    Maybe I'm finally getting used to the Kenta schedule.
    I'm up way earlier than necessary, and on the road to Mirako way earlier than necessary.
    Next to me, Kenta is telling me more about spiders than is at all necessary.
    KENTA: "...but because of the vacuum seal on the delivery packages, prices can be unreasonable."
    TAKERU: "Uh huh."
    KENTA: "My first shipment I wasn't as lucky, but I think the per-specimen cost on this most recent batch was closer to 8000 yen."
    TAKERU: "Uh huh."
    TAKERU: "Wait, you're paying how much for a spider?"
    KENTA: "They're arthropods. Different taxon."
    TAKERU: "How much per arthropod?"
    KENTA: "On average, 8,000 yen."
    TAKERU: "How on earth do you afford all that? Is your family loaded or something?"
    That'd make sense. They shipped Kenta off here and then gave him a budget to shut him up.
    KENTA: "Well I sold the coins for about 200,000. So that's maybe 20% profit but I'd have to be looking at the spreadsheet to get you exact numbers."
    TAKERU: "You actually make money off this stuff?"
    KENTA: "Given the time invested in auction sites I wouldn't call it much of a return."
    KENTA: "And you have to keep careful track of everything."
    TAKERU: "Maybe Meiko should've contracted this festival junk out to you instead..."
    KENTA: "Festival junk?"
    We're on the Shizukawa bridge now.
    I pause to pull the notebook and assorted forms out of my bookbag.
    TAKERU: "Yeah. Look at this stuff."
    KENTA: "You're joining the student council?"
    TAKERU: "No? Meiko's a friend of mine, she's apparently in charge of the festival committee. Somehow I volunteered to handle some of this."
    TAKERU: "Speaking of which... Do you know where I can find Mitani Mitsuo?"
    KENTA: "Who?"
    TAKERU: "He's president of the math club."
    KENTA: "No. Why?"
    TAKERU: "You'd think he'd be able to add up a bunch of numbers correctly but he totally screwed up this budget form. I need to find him and make him redo it."
    TAKERU: "How about... Ito Naoji?"
    KENTA: "Never heard of him."
    TAKERU: "According to this he's in you're class. Come on..."
    TAKERU: "Okay, you ever meet a Haruki Natsumi?"
    KENTA: "No. Sorry."
    TAKERU: "That was a trick question. You argue with Natsumi outside my classroom like every day!"
    KENTA: "That doesn't mean I should pay her any attention."
    TAKERU: "And she was the one helping you dunk all those spiders in formaldehyde yesterday! Come on Kenta, you have to pay more attention to other people."
    KENTA: "Things like names aren't important to me. If her name's Natsumi, then fine. I appreciate her for helping me out and occassionally changing her opinions to better ones."
    TAKERU: "But other people sure care if you remember their names. It makes it seem like you don't care about them."
    KENTA: "I don't follow."
    TAKERU: "Like... Where is your tie right now? Your shirt's inside-out again too."
    KENTA: "Is that important?"
    TAKERU: "It sure makes it seem like you don't care about
