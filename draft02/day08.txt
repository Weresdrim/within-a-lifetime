label day08:

    Maybe I'm finally getting used to the Kenta schedule.
    I'm up way earlier than necessary, and on the road to Mirako way earlier than necessary.
    Next to me, Kenta is telling me more about spiders than is at all necessary.
    KENTA: "...but because of the vacuum seal on the delivery packages, prices can be unreasonable."
    TAKERU: "Uh huh."
    KENTA: "My first shipment I wasn't as lucky, but I think the per-specimen cost on this most recent batch was closer to 8000 yen."
    TAKERU: "Uh huh."
    TAKERU: "Wait, you're paying how much for a spider?"
    KENTA: "They're arthropods. Different taxon."
    TAKERU: "How much per arthropod?"
    KENTA: "On average, 8,000 yen."
    TAKERU: "How on earth do you afford all that? Is your family loaded or something?"
    That'd make sense. They shipped Kenta off here and then gave him a budget to shut him up.
    KENTA: "Well I sold the coins for about 200,000. So that's maybe 20% profit but I'd have to be looking at the spreadsheet to get you exact numbers."
    TAKERU: "You actually make money off this stuff?"
    KENTA: "Given the time invested in auction sites I wouldn't call it much of a return."
    KENTA: "And you have to keep careful track of everything."
    TAKERU: "Maybe Meiko should've contracted this festival junk out to you instead..."
    KENTA: "Festival junk?"
    We're on the Shizukawa bridge now.
    I pause to pull the notebook and assorted forms out of my bookbag.
    TAKERU: "Yeah. Look at this stuff."
    KENTA: "You're joining the student council?"
    TAKERU: "No? Meiko's a friend of mine, she's apparently in charge of the festival committee. Somehow I volunteered to handle some of this."
    TAKERU: "Speaking of which... Do you know where I can find Mitani Mitsuo?"
    KENTA: "Who?"
    TAKERU: "He's president of the math club."
    KENTA: "No. Why?"
    TAKERU: "You'd think he'd be able to add up a bunch of numbers correctly but he totally screwed up this budget form. I need to find him and make him redo it."
    TAKERU: "How about... Ito Naoji?"
    KENTA: "Never heard of him."
    TAKERU: "According to this he's in you're class. Come on..."
    TAKERU: "Okay, you ever meet a Haruki Natsumi?"
    KENTA: "No. Sorry."
    TAKERU: "That was a trick question. You argue with Natsumi outside my classroom like every day!"
    KENTA: "That doesn't mean I should pay her any attention."
    TAKERU: "And she was the one helping you dunk all those spiders in formaldehyde yesterday! Come on Kenta, you have to pay more attention to other people."
    KENTA: "Things like names aren't important to me. If her name's Natsumi, then fine. I appreciate her for helping me out and occassionally changing her opinions to better ones."
    TAKERU: "But other people sure care if you remember their names. It makes it seem like you don't care about them."
    KENTA: "I don't follow."
    TAKERU: "Like... Where is your tie right now? Your shirt's inside-out again too."
    KENTA: "Is that important?"
    TAKERU: "It sure makes it seem like you're lazy. Or that you're some delinquent that doesn't care about Mirako or its rules."
    KENTA: "I don't mind if other people think I'm lazy. I do like our school. Its rules I don't really care about."
    KENTA: "I guess you do if you're going through all of those papers. Unless the details work has to do with arthropods, I don't care about it. What you have there seems very dull."
    TAKERU: "No kidding it's dull."
    TAKERU: "I'm just doing it as a favor to my friend though."
    KENTA: "Yes, it's very odd that you'd go through all that trouble when you've never even been to Mirako's festival before."
    TAKERU: "True enough..."
    TAKERU: "What's it like?"
    KENTA: "I'm not sure."
    TAKERU: "Weren't you here for last year?"
    KENTA: "Yes but I'm not sure it was a normal festival as there was quite a commotion. The accident might've changed how things work. That thing burned down."
    TAKERU: "Hang on... 'That' thing?"
    KENTA: "The boathouse. You can be very thick sometimes but you do see that, don't you?"
    He's pointing at the ruin.
    TAKERU: "That burned at the festival last year?"
    KENTA: "That's what I just said. You can be very thick some - "
    I ignore Kenta.
    For some reason the ruin has always seemed just like that... A 'ruin.' Imagining it not burned down out there is screwing with me. Seems like it's been standing there deserted for decades.
    TAKERU: "What happened?"
    KENTA: "It burned down."
    TAKERU: "Yeah, but... how? Why?"
    KENTA: "Presumably it caught fire."
    TAKERU: "Never mind. I'll ask Meiko or someone."
    KENTA: "Who?"
    TAKERU: "I'll also ask her where I should go to find all these people for the paperwork because it's pretty obvious you're not going to be helpful there."
    KENTA: "I'm a helpful person. Try me."
    We walk up the hill to Mirako, but of course Kenta can't place a single one of the names I give him.
    Yeah, maybe Kenta's helpful, in a roundabout way.
    I can't think too deeply about it though, too much to do today. Getting distracted by that charred building on the river won't help.
    
    I manage to track down two or three people on my list before it's time for homeroom, mostly by asking random upperclassmen if they know so-and-so, getting redirected to go find some other so-and-so, and so on.
    Most of these people are a year ahead of me, but I guess that figures, if they're in charge of clubs.
    You'd never think there were this many student groups at Mirako, given the sleepiness of the towns. There are a surprising amount of students here.
    ...And it seems like everyone's involved. Unlike Tohoku. We only had sports teams, basically.
    Or maybe I just didn't see beyond my own immediate surroundings.
    Regardless, I arrive at class with a few minutes to go. A few of my classmates are milling around chatting, and Meiko has her desk covered in papers, as usual.
    TAKERU: "Hey. Busy with festival stuff?"
    MEIKO: "Hi Takeru, good morning. Of course. I'll probably have my hands full for this whole month."
    MEIKO: "How are things going on your end?"
    TAKERU: "Found a few people this morning. But still a lot to go. Everyone's terrible at filling out these forms, apparently."
    MEIKO: "Ah, haha, well I'm glad you're making progress, but I meant to ask if you enjoyed your day off. I didn't see you around."
    TAKERU: "Oh."
    TAKERU: "I guess so."
    TAKERU: "Did you know Mirako has a basement below the basement?"
    MEIKO: "Hm, I guess no I didn't. What does that have to do with your day off?"
    TAKERU: "Oh, nothing. I just met up with my club is all."
    I instantly regret mentioning the supernatural club and 'my' in the same sentence.
    MEIKO: "Ah, neat, so you've found a group you're interested in. Now I won't need to open up room on the festival committee. So did Natsumi finally convince you to join the baseball team?"
    TAKERU: "No, nothing like that. It's not really my club, really, I just sort of put my name down because they're short on members and one of the leaders is in my class, I don't really - "
    MEIKO: "Interesting. So you joined the supernatural club?"
    TAKERU: "Wait, hang on, how do you know that?"
    MEIKO: "That's the only club application I had to turn down for being short on members."
    MEIKO: "Good on you for helping them off the ground, though. I'm sure Hagami appreciates it."
    TAKERU: "You know her?"
    MEIKO "I know that she's in our class."
    We both look backwards at the same time. Hagami is there at her desk in the back row, sure, but her headphones are on.
    She doesn't notice us looking her way.
    MEIKO: "...As a transfer student, she must feel out of place, so I've reached out to her a bit, but..."
    TAKERU: "Didn't get much of a response?"
    MEIKO: "No..."
    TAKERU: "Sounds about right."
    MEIKO: "I guess it's impossible to please everyone, isn't it?"
    TAKERU: "Yeah. Too bad, Meiko, you'll have to settle for 95% of our class idolizing you instead of 100%."
    MEIKO: "Oh, haha, I'm sure it's nothing like that."
    NATSUMI: "Hii, good morning."
    NATSUMI: "Guess what?"
    TAKERU: "What?"
    NATSUMI: "I'm on time."
    TAKERU: "Am I supposed to be impressed?"
    MEIKO: "Ah! Then that means I'm running late!"
    NATSUMI: "Sheesh, good morning to you too."
    Meiko takes her spot in front of the class as the noise dies down.
    MEIKO: "Good morning everyone! Hope you're looking forward to another week at Mirako."
    MEIKO: "Don't forget we have a math test tomorrow. I'm hoping we can all - "
    MEIKO: "Yes, Natsumi?"
    NATSUMI: "That means there's study session tonight, yeah?"
    MEIKO: "Right. I'll be hosting in the library."
    There's some cheering, mostly from Natsumi.
    MEIKO: "And another reminder, the first round of club applications are due by the end of this week."
    MEIKO: "The student council will be considering budget requests for the festival until - "
    MEIKO: "Yes, Natsumi?"
    NATSUMI: "I heard the fireworks are back and better than ever, yeah?"
    MEIKO: "You must have heard wrong. Those are still canceled." 
    ...there's some grumbling, mostly from Natsumi.
    MEIKO: "But I'm sure we can come together as a school and enjoy..."
    Meiko continues but Natsumi is no longer interested.
    TAKERU: "Where'd you hear that from?"
    NATSUMI: "Oh, nobody, but I figure if I bug Meiko enough she'll eventually change her mind."
    MEIKO: "Change my mind about what?"
    NATSUMI: "You're back! Takeru was just saying he was going to change your mind about the fireworks now that he's on the festival planning committee."
    TAKERU: "I'm not - "
    MEIKO: "Sorry, that's straight from the staff. I'm on your side for this one, but we're just students. There's only so much influence we have."
    NATSUMI: "Hmmm..."
    NATSUMI: "Then I guess you'll have to get them to change their minds. That should be easy for the great Meiko."
    MEIKO: "Flattering me won't work either."
    NATSUMI: "Takeru, you'll at least promise me you'll get the principal and them to get the fireworks back."
    TAKERU: "I'm just Meiko's secretary but I'll pass your feelings along."
    NATSUMI: "Don't betray me like that. I thought we were on the same - "
    MEIKO: "Shh! Mr. Kunida's here."
    
    An hour of nothing. Then another, another --
    NATSUMI: "Hey Takeru..."
    TAKERU: "Yeah..."
    NATSUMI: "Did you get any of that?"
    TAKERU: "No not really."
    TAKERU: "We're doomed tomorrow, aren't we?"
    NATSUMI: "Definitely."
    NATSUMI: "I've got a deal for you."
    TAKERU: "Oh yeah?"
    NATSUMI: "You con Meiko into passing you the answers, and I'll get Kenta to write up the answers for me. Divide and conquer."
    TAKERU: "Brilliant plan."
    MEIKO: "I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that."
    NATSUMI: "Go for it Takeru. It'll be easy for you to win her over."
    MEIKO: "You two just come to the study group tonight and you'll do fine, I promise."
    NATSUMI: "Thaaanks Meiko."
    I make a note not to pair with Natsumi again. It'd be embarassing to fail my first exam here.
    NATSUMI: "Hey Takeru, speaking of Kenta, I finally got him to agree to run our numbers for the tournament."
    NATSUMI: "Come have lunch with us. You can be the mediator while we hash out the deal."
    TAKERU: "So you were just trying to get in his good books by bringing the baseball around to help with the spiders, were you?"
    NATSUMI: "They're arthropods, not - "
    TAKERU: "Don't you start on me. I've got other plans anyway."
    NATSUMI: "Oh ho, eating with Meiko again?"
    MEIKO: "I need to check in with the student council. I'll see you all later."
    NATSUMI: "Hmmm..."
    She squints at me as I walk out the door.
    NATSUMI: "If you're secretly joining the swim team or something I'm going to be mad, you hear?"
    TAKERU: "Bye, Natsumi."
    
    When I show up at the old library, the door is open for me. I can hear Hagami inside, but she quiets down when I enter and greets me with a smile, then looks to Mana.
    MANA: "Takeru! Hi! You made it!"
    TAKERU: "Did you think I wasn't going to show back up?"
    MANA: "Well we thought maybe..."
    She glances at Hagami.
    MANA: "Maybe after you ran into the ghost last night, you wouldn't want to show up at the supernatural club again."
    TAKERU: "Very funny."
    While the huge circle of candles is mostly gone, the table is still as cluttered as ever. I clear away some looseleaf paper, a stray wax blob, two illustrations of Seiji the Somethinghearted, then pull out a chair and sit down.
    While Hagami pages through some huge book. Mana chatters about people I've never heard of. Hagami nods.
    All in all going on the ghost hunt was worth it if I can just eat here and doze off every day instead of getting wound up with Natsumi or her accomplice Kenta.
    MANA: "...but Hagami, it'd be great if you got more involved. I'm appointing you the warden for the next ghost hunt. Maybe next week?"
    HAGAMI: "Sorry."
    MANA: "Oh whoops I mean not ghost hunt, you're warden for the field expedition next week?"
    HAGAMI: "...Sorry."
    MANA: "You don't need to pretend you didn't have fun just because Takeru's here."
    MANA: "But it was fun, Takeru, right?"
    TAKERU: "That's probably the weird initiation rite I've seen. And I thought Tohoku was bad. I didn't think a two-girl club would go in heavy on the hazing."
    MANA: "What?"
    HAGAMI: "Don't underestimate us."
    MANA: "Wait, what, Hagami?"
    MANA: "Oh never mind."
    Hagami is fully sheltered behind a book at this point, so Mana turns back to me.
    MANA: "I've never seen a ghost myself before. Sure there are sometimes hauntings and that sort of thing, but I had mostly thought those were rumors."
    MANA: "And didn't you say you had a friend that knew about some of this too? Like she had a chess set go missing?"
    TAKERU: "Hang on, back up. You met her last night, didn't you?"
    MANA: "Who are you talking about again?"
    TAKERU: "Hikari."
    MANA: "Oh, I don't think I know her. I may have been around Mirako a lot but I still only really know people in my own year."
    MANA: "Her name's Hikari though?"
    TAKERU: "...She introduced herself."
    I feel a headache coming on and not a mundane one from physical illness but like I missed the last step on the stairs and somehow ended up somewhere very different and I need to backpedal to find my footing.
    TAKERU: "Alright. Let's figure this out. What exactly happened last night? You and I were about to go up the stairs, and then..."
    TAKERU: "Hikari showed up."
    MANA: "Uhh... I'm not sure who you mean."
    Another pause.
    The only sound is the low orchestra from the radio.
    TAKERU: "My friend. You stole her chess set. Came late to pick up some books or something."
    MANA: "Oh, you mean when the ghost showed up!"
    MANA: "Well, it could've been anything, I guess! Just a stray shadow. I would've thought ghosts were a lot cuter, right? I mean, otherwise what's the point?"
    TAKERU: "We ran into her. I almost literally ran into her."
    MANA: "You were very brave!"
    TAKERU: "Well, I'd say I was more very embarassed then very brave. That rabbit incense, and..."
    Mana just looks confused. Hagami's still hiding but I can tell she's not paying any attention to her book.
    MANA: "The only people I saw last night were you and Hagami. Sorry, Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Why..."
    MANA: "Or sorry! I should count ghosts as people too!"
    TAKERU: "I'm sick of this. There's not..."
    TAKERU: "There are no ghosts in Mirako. There aren't any ghosts anywhere. Please, just cut it out. I feel like I'm going crazy."
    MANA: "No... No ghosts?"
    MANA: "Then what were you doing last night? Why were you so spooked? I don't - "
    TAKERU: "Look, Mana. I know you guys are trying to scare me or something, or maybe you have something against Hikari, but..."
    TAKERU: "It's not funny any more."
    TAKERU: "I don't want to get into details but there's a reason I transferred into Mirako. I've had some trouble telling what's real and what's in my head. So if you're trying to screw with me..."
    TAKERU: "You've made your point. Just tell me what really happened. I don't like it when my so-called friends screw with me or lie to me or - "
    MANA: "Takeru, I don't... What - "
    I jump. We're cut off by a blast of music.
    When I turn around, I see Hagami has her finger on the radio volume control. After a few seconds, she lowers it back.
    ...And then she flips another page in that oversized book.
    Mana and I stare at each other, when Hagami finally speaks.
    HAGAMI: "Hm."
    HAGAMI: "I knew that incense was a little shady."
    She pulls over the copper rabbit burner from across the table, crosses the room, and empties its contents into the trash.
    For once she doesn't break eye contact. I gulp, but it seems that's all she wanted to say.
    Hagami just sits down and turns another page.
    MANA: "Oh. Okay that must've been it. You're right Hagami."
    MANA: "Let's talk about something else. Do you have any plans for the festival, Takeru?"
    TAKERU: "Not really, but it's still almost a month out, isn't it? Must be a big deal around here."
    MANA: "Of course! That's why it's important that we get the first draft of Seiji done to have ready to sell. But before that we need to be an official club! And that means recruiting! And that means..."
    MANA: "Phew. It's a headache, is what it is."
    MANA: "Takeru! Do you know anyone interested in the supernatural?"
    TAKERU: "I hardly know anyone, and I'm hardly interested in the supernatural myself."
    MANA: "That's okay. Hagami and I will find someone."
    HAGAMI: "Takeru can fudge it for us."
    MANA: "Huh? Takeru, you could get us official club status? Do you have secret identity? Or do you have blackmail material on the student council? Or - "
    TAKERU: "Er, I have a friend on the planning committee, but she's kind of a by-the-book person."
    MANA: "Oh..."
    MANA: "But either way, you've got to come. Hagami and I will run an illegal booth if we have to!"
    HAGAMI: "...I might not be there."
    MANA: "Hagami?"
    HAGAMI: "Sounds crowded. Too many people."
    MANA: "Well I've still got a couple weeks to convince you!"
    MANA: "But I guess that'll have to wait until tomorrow... Class is almost starting."
    MANA: "Hagami, Takeru, you better hurry too or you'll be late. Bye!"
    Hagami and I both sit as the door slams behind Mana. I speak first.
    TAKERU: "So that blank form you put in for the festival..."
    TAKERU: "Are you going to sign up with Mana's club? Or on your own?"
    HAGAMI: "Not sure."
    TAKERU: "Look, I can push Meiko a bit but I don't think she's going to accept a half-filled page from a half-baked club."
    HAGAMI: "...I'll figure it out."
    HAGAMI: "Thanks for not mentioning it to Mana."
    TAKERU: "No problem."
    I stand and gather my things as Hikari puts down her book.
    But she doesn't rise to follow.
    HAGAMI: "About Hikari."
    TAKERU: "Er, what?"
    HAGAMI: "Hikari, last night."
    HAGAMI: "Takeru... We're you're friends. If Mana says she didn't meet anyone, she's saying that because that's what she believes."
    HAGAMI: "We're not... Nobody's trying to mess with you."
    TAKERU: "That's good to know... I guess."
    As I open the door - 
    HAGAMI: "And..."
    HAGAMI: "If you say you met Hikari, I believe you."
    HAGAMI: "I..."
    Hagami avoids my eyes. I want to ask her what she means, but she slinks off down the hall as I hold open the door.
    It seems pointless to speculate but I'd guess she had more to say.
    While I trace my steps down the unused wing back to class, I add another item to my mental to-do list: find out exactly what Hagami knows about Hikari.
    Apart from Mana, it's only Kenta and Natsumi that I've seen pretending like Hikari doesn't exist. I could see Kenta being unintentionally rude like that and maybe Natsumi holds a grudge.
    Mana might be a first-year student, but she lives in Shizukawa. Maybe she's trying to fit in with the older girls by not acknowledging the pariah? But that seems weird...
    Hagami, at least, is a transfer like me. If there's some reason everyone else would rather forget about Hikari, Hagami at least will give me a straight answer.
    And I should ask Meiko. Meiko wouldn't lie.
    I'll find some time after afternoon classes.
    
    But the time doesn't come.
    When I arrive back at class, I'm just in time to catch the beginning of our English class, and there's hardly time to talk to anyone.
    ...and then Meiko is gone as soon as class lets out.
    I mean to catch her, but from her all I get is a quick wave before she vanishes into the chaos. I'd tail her but there's someone standing in my way.
    NATSUMI: "Hey."
    TAKERU: "Oh, Natsumi. I was about to talk to Meiko about - "
    NATSUMI: "About the test tomorrow?"
    TAKERU: "No, about - " 
    NATSUMI: "Then you're talking about the wrong thing! We've got study group."
    TAKERU: "Oh. I kind of forgot about that."
    NATSUMI: "This is why you're going to fail."
    TAKERU: "Don't remind me."
    NATSUMI: "Well come on, let's get going. This is so unfair anyway. What kind of teacher just throws tests into the middle of the year? Midterms are good enough for everyone else, but no, Kunida's got to..."
    We take the stairs down to the library as Natsumi gripes.
    I kind of wish she'd walk faster or else I'll be forced to pair up with her again. And in that case I'd get just as much studying done as if I'd stayed home and helped Kenta embalm his bugs.
    When we arrive, my worst fear is realized. Everyone's already sitting down, paired up. It looks the whole class is down here too, although I don't spot Hagami. The only ones not sitting are Meiko at the front, and...
    TAKERU: "Hikari!"
    HIKARI: "Oh. Hello Takeru."
    I run over before Natsumi can claim my partner.
    TAKERU: "Hey. I don't know why I didn't expect to see you here."
    HIKARI: "Probably because I've gotten antisocial."
    TAKERU: "Er..."
    TAKERU: "Well, whatever. Do you want to get started on the practice problems?"
    HIKARI: "The what?"
    TAKERU: "Kunida handed them out this morning. Were you not in class again?"
    HIKARI: "No."
    HIKARI: "And I'm more hear to watch people than study, really."
    TAKERU: "You're not worried about tomorrow?"
    I'm interrupted by a tap on the shoulder.
    NATSUMI: "Takeru. I hope some of Kenta has rubbed off on you since last time."
    TAKERU: "What?"
    NATSUMI: "We're partners again, so you better not be as useless as before or I'm toast."
    TAKERU: "Is there seriously no one else you can team up with?"
    I scan the room but the only two who notice are a pair of guys I recognize as baseball players, sitting in the back row. They both quickly pretend not to notice me. Guess Natsumi has a reputation.
    TAKERU: "You'll have to find a group of three or something."
    NATSUMI: "Why? Who are you working with?"
    TAKERU: "I - "
    While I was looking away, Hikari must've slipped out of the room. She's now outside, watching us through the glass.
    TAKERU: "Damn it anyway."
    
    As expected, Natsumi and I are only productive when Meiko or some other kind soul has a spare moment to guide us along.
    I'm about to call it early and just go back to the dorms when stands up and stretches.
    NATSUMI: "Takeru, what happened? Weren't you supposed to steal Kenta's brain for me? What went wrong?"
    TAKERU: "I forgot. Sorry."
    NATSUMI: "Useless, useless..."
    NATSUMI: "Let's just get Meiko to show us how to do this one. Once she's done with those traitors over there, of course."
    Natsumi glares at her teammates across the aisle.
    NATSUMI: "Those guys, not jumping in to help out their captain..."
    TAKERU: "Can't blame them..."
    NATSUMI: "You want to say that a little louder?"
    TAKERU: "I'm good."
    NATSUMI: "That's what I thought, especially when this is the second time you've let me down in the info-gathering department. Third, if you count last study session."
    TAKERU: "Then what was the first?"
    NATSUMI: "You never got me the dirt on Meiko!"
    TAKERU: "There's do dirt. Besides, do you really care about that?"
    NATSUMI: "Kind of. I mean, she obviuosly does. You're sure you don't have some scoop you're hiding from everyone?"
    TAKERU: "Yeah. We grew up in the same neighborhood. That's about it."
    TAKERU: "What do you mean Meiko cares about it?"
    NATSUMI: "Listen, I know you guys go way back but Meiko and I have been best buds since day one here at Mirako so I've been able to mostly piece together when something's on her mind."
    NATSUMI: "And since you showed up she's been weirder, somehow."
    TAKERU: "It's probably just the festival."
    NATSUMI: "Maybe. But if you're holding out on me and there actually is something juicy... I won't forgive you."
    MEIKO: "What're you two arguing about."
    NATSUMI: "Oh! Hey Meiko! Takeru keeps saying number 23 is unsolveable but I know I'm right about this one and he just can't say he's wrong."
    TAKERU: "Don't throw me under the bus like that. Weren't you the one that - "
    NATSUMI: "So if you can show us how to solve it I'm sure Takeru would love it."
    MEIKO: "Sure, which problem again?"
    Meiko demonstrates.
    I still fail to learn anything useful.
    It's a pretty crystalized summary of the entirety of today.
    NATSUMI: "I'm going to be cramming all night at this rate. This sucks."
    NATSUMI: "Maybe we should give up and go back to that blackmail plan."
    TAKERU: "Blackmail plan?"
    NATSUMI: "Yeah, the one I had this morning. You get leverage on Meiko, get the answers from her, then pass them to me."
    TAKERU: "Okay, first, what leverage? And second why would I pass anything to you?"
    NATSUMI: "It's my idea so you owe me."
    TAKERU: "Brilliant idea, Natsumi."
    NATSUMI: "Thanks."
    TAKERU: "I should've forced Hikari to stick around..."
    NATSUMI: "What're you muttering about?"
    TAKERU: "Oh, I forgot, there's some sort of code of Hikari silence."
    NATSUMI: "Still not reading you."
    TAKERU: "That's fine. I'll ask Meiko later."
    Natsumi still has her eyes on the math textbook.
    NATSUMI: "...You know."
    NATSUMI: "I really wouldn't do that."
    TAKERU: "Do what? Talk to Meiko?"
    NATSUMI: "Yeah."
    NATSUMI: "Like I said she's been..."
    NATSUMI: "Well. Something's on her mind. The Mirako festival, your showing up out of nowhere, or something else, I don't know, maybe she secretly is worried about Kunida's dumb test."
    NATSUMI: "But something's got her gears grinding recently, so..."
    NATSUMI: "I just wouldn't bring that up. If you care about Meiko."
    TAKERU: "Bring up Hikari?"
    NATSUMI: "I mean, that's what I said, yeah?"
    She looks up but I still can't read the look in Natsumi's eye. Something about it is... off.
    NATSUMI: "I know I joke around a lot but I'm serious for once."
    NASTUMI: "Don't bring up uncomfortable stuff for no reason."
    TAKERU: "..."
    TAKERU: "I actually think I'm going to head out. See you Natsumi."
    NATSUMI: "Hey, good luck tomorrow."
    But she still doesn't look me in the eye as I walk out the door.
    What was that about? She's really going to just sit there?
    Fine.
    I find it difficult to believe anything could get under Meiko's skin. My thought is more that Natsumi is the ringleader of some sort of clique-y group or... something around here.
    That's what sports team captains are supposed to be like, right?
    But this is some backwater specialty school, not Tohoku. These things don't happen here.
    Tohoku...
    Was it like this back there? Unspoken codes about unspeakable students? I don't really remember it like that but who can say if I remember anything.
    After all... There's still that letter burning a hole in my backpack.
    I wonder if it's Jun telling me that I'm now an unmentionable in the Tohoku locker room. Whatever. I shouldn't care about them any more.
    Nevertheless, I'm still lost enough in my head that I wander down a familiar staircase into the unused wing.
    Isn't that the tearoom on the left?
