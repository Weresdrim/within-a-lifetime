    It's an early day.
    That's fine by me. Anything beats the nightmare that was last night.
    I don't want to see these things over and over, especially these revisions that I'm sure never happened in real life. That's just my mind playing tricks on me. Right?
    Still, I walk in silence.
    Kenta next to me is also quiet, for once. 
    If he were in my class, I'd put it down to nerves for the math test today, but Kunida's not even his teacher. So whatever's keeping him shut up will remain a mystery, because I'm certainly not asking to find out.
    We pass the ruin on the water. The ruin that, according to Kenta, is less than a year old.
    Fine. At this rate I'm glad it hasn't up and disappeared on me. It wouldn't even surprise me at this point.
    I wonder: is it like Hikari said, that the past is flexible, or am I just a barely-treated schizophrenic with poor powers of recall?
    ...Probably that last one.
    Still. I think I'd rather have that stupid building change out from under me than my memories from Tohoku. Even with Jun's letter, and those fake dreams of that practice one day... I was still well-liked back there. That has to be it.
    KENTA: "You're going to be late, Takeru. Stop staring at the river and let's get moving."
    TAKERU: "Oh. Sorry."
    TAKERU: "I wasn't so worried about showing up on time seeing as how it's a full hour early."
    KENTA: "No, this is right on time."
    TAKERU: "I meant an hour before classes actually start, which probably still counts as late on your crazy schedule. I'm amazed anyone's even at school this early. What do you even do in the morning, just sit at your desk?"
    KENTA: "Yes. Or talk to people."
    TAKERU: "Who's even there?"
    KENTA: "My friends usually arrive on time."
    TAKERU: "Right..."
    We keep walking but I don't why I keep frowning.
    TAKERU: "Hey Kenta."
    KENTA: "Good morning."
    TAKERU: "I still don't get you at all. You have friends here? No one bullies you?"
    KENTA: "Yes to both, for the most part."
    TAKERU: "How about before you came to Mirako?"
    KENTA: "It was a little rougher, but I was fine."
    TAKERU: "Great... I was apparently an outcast as a baseball star and you were cruising along fine as a bug collector..."
    KENTA: "It's not really difficult. Being honest and straightforward is usually enough for people to trust you."
    TAKERU: "Your honesty and straightforwardness is basically just rudeness, Kenta. And isn't your main way of communicating with people to argue at them?"
    KENTA: "If someone is wrong, it's a friend's duty to change their mind."
    TAKERU: "That's ridiculous."
    KENTA: "Actually I have a few counterexamples to change your mind. For instance..."
    I only half tune in Kenta from that point on our daily walk, but it feels better having him rambling at me than standing next to each other in silence.
    And maybe he has a point. Hell, why am I even bringing up these pointless old not-memories of mine, with him?
    I knew he'd respond like this. Maybe that's why.
