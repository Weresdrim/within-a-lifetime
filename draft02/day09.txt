label day09

    It's an early day.
    That's fine by me. Anything beats the nightmare that was last night.
    I don't want to see these things over and over, especially these revisions that I'm sure never happened in real life. That's just my mind playing tricks on me. Right?
    Still, I walk in silence.
    Kenta next to me is also quiet, for once. 
    If he were in my class, I'd put it down to nerves for the math test today, but Kunida's not even his teacher. So whatever's keeping him shut up will remain a mystery, because I'm certainly not asking to find out.
    We pass the ruin on the water. The ruin that, according to Kenta, is less than a year old.
    Fine. At this rate I'm glad it hasn't up and disappeared on me. It wouldn't even surprise me at this point.
    I wonder: is it like Hikari said, that the past is flexible, or am I just a barely-treated schizophrenic with poor powers of recall?
    ...Probably that last one.
    Still. I think I'd rather have that stupid building change out from under me than my memories from Tohoku. Even with Jun's letter, and those fake dreams of that practice one day... I was still well-liked back there. That has to be it.
    KENTA: "You're going to be late, Takeru. Stop staring at the river and let's get moving."
    TAKERU: "Oh. Sorry."
    TAKERU: "I wasn't so worried about showing up on time seeing as how it's a full hour early."
    KENTA: "No, this is right on time."
    TAKERU: "I meant an hour before classes actually start, which probably still counts as late on your crazy schedule. I'm amazed anyone's even at school this early. What do you even do in the morning, just sit at your desk?"
    KENTA: "Yes. Or talk to people."
    TAKERU: "Who's even there?"
    KENTA: "My friends usually arrive on time."
    TAKERU: "Right..."
    We keep walking but I don't why I keep frowning.
    TAKERU: "Hey Kenta."
    KENTA: "Good morning."
    TAKERU: "I still don't get you at all. You have friends here? No one bullies you?"
    KENTA: "Yes to both, for the most part."
    TAKERU: "How about before you came to Mirako?"
    KENTA: "It was a little rougher, but I was fine."
    TAKERU: "Great... I was apparently an outcast as a baseball star and you were cruising along fine as a bug collector..."
    KENTA: "It's not really difficult. Being honest and straightforward is usually enough for people to trust you."
    TAKERU: "Your honesty and straightforwardness is basically just rudeness, Kenta. And isn't your main way of communicating with people to argue at them?"
    KENTA: "If someone is wrong, it's a friend's duty to change their mind."
    TAKERU: "That's ridiculous."
    KENTA: "Actually I have a few counterexamples to change your mind. For instance..."
    I only half tune in Kenta from that point on our daily walk, but it feels better having him rambling at me than standing next to each other in silence.
    And maybe he has a point. Hell, why am I even bringing up these pointless old not-memories of mine, with him?
    I knew he'd respond like this. Maybe that's why.
    
    Class is empty. Not even Meiko is here this early.
    I'm almost tempted to try to find more of the club leaders on my festival hitlist, but it's not like they'd be here either. Instead, it's time to cram.
    And slowly the room fills up. The ball players, chatting nervously, the guy in front of me, also last-minute studying, Hagami, headphones on... No sign of Hikari though.
    Finally Natsumi shows up, and offers me a salute.
    TAKERU: "What's that for?"
    NATSUMI: "Isn't that a thing? You know, between condemned? 'We who are about to die salute something something?'"
    TAKERU: "I have no idea what you're talking about."
    NATSUMI: "Fine. Then... Let's try this."
    TAKERU: "You're waving your arms around. What's that supposed to be?"
    NATSUMI: "The sign of the cross. May you rest in peace."
    TAKERU: "I think I'll do fine."
    NATSUMI: "Seriously?"
    TAKERU: "Maybe if you'd spent more time studying instead of picking up these weird comedy routines you'd be more confident too."
    NATSUMI: "If I fail my excuse is that I spent all my time at batting practice. Besides, I don't really care that much as long as I'm not bottom of the class, so, I'm all set."
    TAKERU: "You're saying you think that I'm going to be bottom of the class? That's just cruel."
    NATSUMI: "I mean, I wouldn't complain if you were, that'd make me a look a ton better."
    TAKERU: "So this is why you always wanted to pair up with me..."
    MEIKO: "Natsumi, are you distracting Takeru?"
    NATSUMI: "Huh uh what? No! Hi Meiko, good morning! Takeru and I were just going over the strategy for uh..."
    NATSUMI: "Don't you have an inspirational speech to give?"
    MEIKO: "I was going to pass seeing as we have Mr. Kunida's test first thing this morning..."
    NATSUMI: "You have to go rally the troops! I know Takeru and I were counting on you to motivate us."
    TAKERU: "Leave me out of this."
    MEIKO: "Maybe you're right. I'll try to encourage everyone. That's my job as class rep, isn't it?"
    NATSUMI: "You're the best, Meiko."
    NATSUMI: "...Stop glaring at me Takeru. While she's speaking we've got a whole extra two minutes to study."
    TAKERU: "You're smarter than you - "
    NATSUMI: "So quick, get this down: when I elbow you twice I need an answer, but when I elbow three times I've got an answer for you, so - "
    TAKERU: "Rest in peace, Natsumi."
    NATSUMI: "Jerk."
    
    But afterwards I feel like I came out on top. As everyone departs for lunch, it's all I can do to stop myself from taunting Natsumi, who still sits scowling the desk next to mine.
    Still, I don't care much to go over Kunida's test blow by blow with Natsumi. I'll celebrate my first probably-not-failed test at the Mirako School by eating lunch somewhere far, far away from here.
    It's funny how quickly I've leared the layout of the bottom floor, east side, old stairs that compose the unused wing. The layout of the rest of this needlessly large school is still lost on me, but I can get around here at least.
    I arrive outside the old library to the familiar low hum of the radio. Although today, the door is closed. Odd.
    TAKERU: "Hey."
    HAGAMI: "...Hi."
    TAKERU: "Where's Mana?"
    Hagami glances around as if she hadn't noticed that the only occupants of this room are me, her, and a thousand paperbacks spread over the table.
    But she just shrugs for a moment before returning to her book.
    I pull up a chair, clear off a pile of Mana's ridiculous ghost manga, stack some sheet music into a pile, and finally shelve the bronze rabbit censer that's been around here since the ghost hunt.
    TAKERU: "Then it's just me and you today?"
    HAGAMI: "Yes."
    HAGAMI: "Oh well."
    TAKERU: "Please, I'm not that terrible."
    Hagami laughs. I'm a bit relieved that was a joke.
    HAGAMI: "She's sick, I guess."
    TAKERU: "What?"
    HAGAMI: "Oh..."
    HAGAMI: "Mana, I mean. Is..."
    TAKERU: "Oh. Nothing too serious, I hope?"
    HAGAMI: "No, but..."
    HAGAMI: "I wouldn't be surprised if she were out for the next few days."
    TAKERU: "Well give her a 'get well' from me if you see her then."
    TAKERU: "I'm not really sure I'd consider her a fantastic friend but she's definitely made things here more interesting."
    HAGAMI: "A good friend... generally doesn't make things interesting, no."
    No eye contact from Hagami.
    The radio is up louder than usual today. Some guy probably born two hundred years ago is providing German commentary between two orchestral recordings. This is pretty up there for what I'd consider the most boring broadcast of all times.
    And Hagami is reading something titled 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems.' You know. Just light reading. For lunch over music by dead Germans.
    I guess I still don't 'get' Hagami.
    Have we even spent any time together without Mana, since that first night we talked on the bridge? After which she ran away?
    At least she doesn't seem threatened by me any more. Guess I've been downgraded from 'dangerous' to 'familiar.' Like a housecat or something.
    Still, as time ticks on, and we eat in silence... Maybe all Hagami and I had in common was Mana's borderline-crazy talkativity. I can't take the quiet.
    TAKERU: "Hey Hagami."
    HAGAMI: "Hey."
    TAKERU: "What did you mean the other day, when you said you believed me that I'd seen Hikari at school at night?"
    HAGAMI: "...Not much."
    TAKERU: "That's not really helpful."
    TAKERU: "Sorry, I'm trying to figure out if I'm going insane over here or the rest of the school is already nuts."
    TAKERU: "I mean it's probably both, but... still."
    Hagami turns a page.
    HAGAMI: "All I meant is that if you don't know what you saw... You should keep an open mind."
    HAGAMI: "It could've been..."
    TAKERU: "Could've been a ghost? Is that what you mean?"
    By the way she blushes and ducks behind the medical manual, I'm going to take that as a yes."
    TAKERU: "I never would've guessed. Mana used to go on about how you used to be all interested in the occult, but the sophisticated Hagami still believes in things like ghosts?"
    TAKERU: "Sorry. That was probably mean."
    She flips another page. And pointedly doesn't look at me.
    TAKERU: "This whole thing just seems so strange to me when everyone treats someone that I talk with every day like she's the loch ness monster."
    TAKERU: "You don't know her, do you? Hikari?"
    HAGAMI: "No."
    TAKERU: "I guess that makes sense if you're a transfer like me..."
    TAKERU: "You haven't noticed anything weird going on with certain students? Like everyone just gives them the cold shoulder? And once they're out of eyesight just refuses to admit they're real?"
    HAGAMI: "No."
    TAKERU: "..."
    HAGAMI: "That sounds..."
    HAGAMI: "I don't know."
    HAGAMI: "Alarming."
    TAKERU: "Yeah, it's bizarre. I thought Mirako was supposed to be a place that embraced all the slightly-weird people, not hid them in the basement."
    TAKERU: "I thought I'd gotten away from that after my old school. Hell, it almost reminds of Hifumi where after the fall tournament everyone went a solid two weeks without speaking to him."
    TAKERU: "Guess it's the same everywhere."
    HAGAMI: "That sounds... nice."
    TAKERU: "Nice?"
    HAGAMI: "Left alone for a few weeks."
    TAKERU: "Oh."
    TAKERU: "I guess you'd probably rather that I didn't show up here every day."
    TAKERU: "If Mana's not around I guess I'm just a bother. I didn't mean to be annoying really."
    Hagami glances up for a second before her next page, and she only speaks again with a grimace.
    HAGAMI: "Not what I meant."
    HAGAMI: "Did you..."
    TAKERU: "Er..."
    HAGAMI: "You used to be a baseball star. Didn't you?"
    TAKERU: "Sort of. Whoever told you that should stop running their mouth though. I'm not anybody any more."
    HAGAMI: "Isn't that refreshing?"
    TAKERU: "What, being a nobody?"
    She nods.
    TAKERU: "No! Of course not. I used to have a ton of people around me, a whole crowd. And random guys I didn't know would come up to me in the hall. Everyone knew me."
    HAGAMI: "...Terrible."
    TAKERU: "I guess you'd think that. I thought it was a pain then, but now when everything's all uncertain I kind of miss it."
    HAGAMI: "I don't."
    TAKERU: "You don't miss... what?"
    HAGAMI: "Celebrity."
    HAGAMI: "It's quiet here. No one even looks at me twice."
    TAKERU: "You're used to a crowd following you around? What, where did you transfer from? Were you the Haruki Natsumi of your old school?"
    But Hagami doesn't respond, or even look at me.
    TAKERU: "I'd give anything to get back what I had this time last year. Seriously..."
    Hagami just looks sad.
    I look away, but that leaves me with my own thoughts.
    Would I really give anything? What was last year anything? Do I even remember it straight?
    My first year at Tohoku, if I take one set of memories at face value, was a dream. I had the admiration of my teammates and my classmates, and I was bound for great things...
    Another set of memories (dreams?) and the only people who looked up to me were worms and the actual worthy people around me mocked me as if I were a worm as well.
    Hagami, across the table... You can't tell me she can relate to that.
    TAKERU: "Speak for yourself..."
    TAKERU: "Give me back my team any day, all you're talking about sounds very lonely to me."
    HAGAMI: "Sometimes it is."
    HAGAMI: "But I have Mana."
    She glances up.
    HAGAMI: "And..."
    TAKERU: "Yeah?"
    HAGAMI: "Nothing."
    HAGAMI: "Tell me more about Hikari some time."
    TAKERU: "Sure. Maybe you two would get along, seeing as both of you apparently love sitting in empty rooms with the most boring hobbies in the world."
    But Hagami continues to thumb through her medical book with her eyes closed. I won't question whatever black magic lets her absorb information without even looking at the thing, but teasing her just doesn't have any fun in it when she's not paying attention.
    With nothing else to do to make myself busy, I pull out the rejected applications that Meiko assigned me.
    Next up is one where the genius volleyball team managed to misspell his club name on the form. I can't figure out what the clown on the swim team got wrong, but they wrote down all their info below the lines on the form rather than above.
    It's a nice change of pace being a mindless rules-enforcer. Much easier than trying to puzzle out what exactly is happening between everyone here at Mirako.
    The radio hum is interrupted by more German narration, and I get back to work.
    Oh well.
    
    For the next couple of hours, I pay approximately zero attention.
    English, chemistry, history... It's all the same to me: 100% irrelevant because I'm pretty sure I passed today's math test and that's enough for one day.
    That seems to be how everyone else is approaching today too. The only one paying attention to this pointless lecture on chemical bonds is Meiko.
    And one desk away from her, Nastumi snores peacefully. The only thing that could wake her would be... There it is. The bell announcing the end of day.
    NATSUMI: "Hua?"
    MEIKO: "Classes are over. Don't worry, it wasn't anyone calling on you."
    TAKERU: "Go home and get some rest, Natsumi. You were up all night studying, weren't you?"
    NATSUMI: "Studying our tournment bracket, sure. Just came out yesterday! There's nothing like summer baseball to get your blood pumping."
    TAKERU: "And here I was thinking you were actually worried about today..."
    NATSUMI: "Me? Worried?"
    NATSUMI: "Ha!"
    MEIKO: "Takeru's priorities are in the right place."
    NATSUMI: "They're also boring priorities. See you guys later, I've got practice."
    MEIKO: "Take care."
    MEIKO: "Takeru, I meant to catch you at lunch, but you vanished on me. Everything went alright with the test this morning?"
    TAKERU: "It wasn't as bad as I was expecting. Kunida talks big but that wasn't too bad."
    MEIKO: "Haha, I'm glad you think so."
    MEIKO: "Anyway, I just wanted to thank you for going through all those festival papers at the same time as studying. It was a lot to ask from someone who just transfered here."
    TAKERU: "No problem, I've gotten a good start on - "
    TAKERU: "Wait, when did you say you needed all these forms?"
    MEIKO: "Today. I was going to run them by the school staff one last time."
    MEIKO: "...You do have them all corrected, don't you?"
    My stomach is about two feet down off and to the left. That small sense of accomplishment I've been carrying since this morning's test is nowhere to be found.
    TAKERU: "Er..."
    TAKERU: "I'm sorry, I must've forgotten how soon you needed it done."
    TAKERU: "Here's what I've got so far."
    It's about a third of the whole stack, but I can tell by Meiko's wince it's not exactly what she expected.
    MEIKO: "This... Hm..."
    TAKERU: "I'm sorry, it's been a nightmare for me to try and find these people as a transfer. They're all upperclassmen and..."
    MEIKO: "It's fine."
    TAKERU: "Yeah... Guess I screwed up. I shouldn't have put this on the back burner."
    MEIKO: "It was a lot to ask. It's my fault for mismanaging - "
    TAKERU: "No, it's not your fault. I volunteered for this so I should've been able to do whatever you needed me to do."
    TAKERU: "I've got a debt to make up to you, right?"
    I really am sorry, Meiko.
    Vanishing on you like that, back when were both in middle school, and you were going through the roughest time of your life.
    Past me was an insensitive idiot.
    I just wish present me wasn't such an insensitive idiot. I tried to help out with the festival work and now I've just thrown a wrench in things and I feel like crap.
    That's why I'm confused when Meiko's face shows a flash of a grin.
    For a second. Probably just imagining it.
    Because then she sighs and starts paging through the papers.
    MEIKO: "I mean it's not a bad start. I can explain to the staff why these aren't on time."
    TAKERU: "I'll do it."
    MEIKO: "Hm?"
    TAKERU: "Let me talk to the principal or whoever about all this. I wouldn't want you to take the heat for my screwup."
    MEIKO: "Haha, don't worry about it. It's my job."
    TAKERU: "Then let me make it up somehow. There's got to be more to planning the Mirako festival than just signing off on papers, right?"
    TAKERU: "I'm not really cut out for the desk job stuff, so if it turns out there are heavy objects to carry, or you need a warm body to sort stuff, or if you want me to intimidate some guys into signing something, I could - "
    MEIKO: "Really, haha, don't worry about."
    MEIKO: "It's funny to me that you're so into this."
    TAKERU: "Why should it be? I gave you my word so it'd be slimy of me to weasel out with half the job done."
    MEIKO: "I..."
    Meiko glances somewhere off out to the corner of the empty classroom.
    MEIKO: "Actually I had a few errands to run in Shizukawa tomorrow afternoon to find some of the supplies we'll need for the festival. If you're not doing anything..."
    TAKERU: "Sure thing. Even if I'm just standing their carrying what you want, I still need to - "
    NATSUMI: "Oh ho, what's this?"
    TAKERU: "Natsumi? I thought you left."
    NATSUMI: "Maybe, maybe not. But tell me more about what you and Meiko are going to be up to tomorrow afternoon. Sounds... Interesting."
    MEIKO: "Well, if Takeru doesn't change his mind, I have a few spots in Shizukawa I'd like to visit for - "
    NATSUMI: "Aha! She admits it. You see that, Kenta? Shameless."
    TAKERU: "Kenta?"
    KENTA: "Excuse me, I'm still not sure what you brought me here for."
    TAKERU: "Kenta, it's Natsumi. Get out while you can, it can't be anything pleasant."
    NATSUMI: "Takeru! Shut up! Kenta's here because you're going to explain to him how important it is that he runs analytics for the Mirako baseball team during the tournament."
    KENTA: "It's marginally important. To you it might be vital but to me the return on investment for the time means that - "
    NATSUMI: "Help me out here guys! I'm losing him."
    TAKERU: "Sounds like you've got the right idea, Kenta. Leave Natsumi out to dry."
    MEIKO: "What's this about statistics?"
    NATSUMI: "Ahhh, Meiko, you'd never get it. Baseball's a numbers game! And Kenta's my numbers guy! Except even though I got Ken and Hiro his spiders for him he's getting all cagey about crunching the tournament numbers!"
    NATSUMI: "You guys! Your job is to convince him!"
    KENTA: "Don't talk about me like I'm not standing right here."
    MEIKO: "Sorry, Natsumi. We've got to get going, so I hope you can handle whatever it was on your own."
    MEIKO: "You're coming, right Takeru?"
    TAKERU: "What?"
    MEIKO: "Right? Takeru?"
    TAKERU: "Oh, yeah, of course I'm coming. Important business. Sorry Natsumi, you'll have to talk to Kenta yourself."
    NATSUMI: "You two! I knew Meiko was this devious but this a stab in the heart Takeru! I'll make sure everyone knows about your little getaway tomorrow, just you..."
    KENTA: "Your plan was flawed to begin with. If I don't think your opinion is worth listening to, then why would..."
    NATSUMI: "How can you say that about your captain?"
    KENTA: "Who's captain? I thought..."
    The traditional Kenta vs. Natsumi argument fades into the background as Meiko and I escape into the hallway.
    
    TAKERU: "So where are we going again?"
    MEIKO: "I'm headed up to the staff office. I just figured you might a bit of a break of Natsumi."
    TAKERU: "You were right. I guess I'll tag along then, the office is on my way."
    MEIKO: "Your way? Where are you headed?"
    TAKERU: "Oh, just down to the old wing."
    MEIKO: "You found a club? The supernaturalist girls, right?"
    TAKERU: "Oh please no, don't associate me with them. I'm not really club, I just meet up with a friend after classes some days."
    MEIKO: "A friend?"
    When I don't respond, Meiko just smiles.
    The staff office is on the ground floor, not too far from the school entrance. It's packed around here as classes just let out, and there are a couple teachers I recognize passing throug the door. One of them flags me down.
    KUNIDA: "Ah, Takeru. You're early. Do you mind giving me a few minutes before our checkin?"
    TAKERU: "Our... checkin?"
    KUNIDA: "Of course, every week. I'm glad you didn't forget."
    Oh. Right. That. Yes, I forgot, and no, I'm not really glad about it.
    TAKERU: "Sure, I can wait."
    KUNIDA: "Thank you."
    MEIKO: "Mr. Kunida, so you mind if I drop some papers off for Mr. Nishimura?"
    KUNIDA: "Of course, come in. Actually, I'd wanted to talk to you as well."
    I get a look from Kunida -- cheerful as ever, but I guess they want privacy.
    The hall outside is still bustling so I take a few steps away and lean against the wall.
