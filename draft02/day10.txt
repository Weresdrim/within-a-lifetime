label day10:

    There's an agony of time before that shattering feelign coalesces to a single point.
    The center of my forehead.
    Because my idiot roommate is jamming his finger into me like it's a coin return.
    TAKERU: "Kenta! Quit it! I'm awake."
    KENTA: "Are you sure?"
    TAKERU: "Yes I'm sure! What're you still poking me for?"
    KENTA: "Well before you were rolling all over and talking in your sleep, so just because you started talking doesn't mean you woke up."
    TAKERU: "Oh..."
    TAKERU: "Is that why you decided to go and wake me up? Because it's still dark out."
    KENTA: "How light or dark it is outside doesn't have anything to do with the time you need to get up."
    KENTA: "In fact, depending on the season, sunrise and sunset can vary by hours. While I understand you'd rather have a schedule that followed daylight, that wouldn't be feasible because - "
    TAKERU: "Oh, it's just raining out, that's why it's so dark. You could've just said that."
    KENTA: "I was getting there."
    TAKERU: "Could've fooled me."
    I spend a few seconds at the window of our room, looking out over the river. 
    While on most days the surface is perfectly still, today, what little of the water isn't obscured by mist is perturbed by thousands of tiny waves as raindrops fall. It's actually quite the storm.
    The gray space out there starts reflecting on me and the longer the stare the more the haze is the same vagueness I just woke up from where I can't quite place myself but I know that someone probably several people were in pain and was I back at Tohoku again? Or -
    I turn away.
    KENTA: " - and you know how deliveries can be so inconsistent up here. If the weather delays my shipment by more than a day I'll get a bad review. This is bad."
    KENTA: "Are you even listening?"
    TAKERU: "No, not really."
    TAKERU: "Kenta, you have medications you take, right?"
    KENTA: "Yes, several. Why?"
    TAKERU: "Where do you fill them? Is there a pharmacy in town or something?"
    KENTA: "A small one. Personally I take the bus to the city every once in a while, but I can show you if you like, on a slightly nicer day."
    TAKERU: "But I mean, the school doesn't keep track of whether you go there or not? They don't have anything set up with doctors to keep tabs on you?"
    KENTA: "Of course not. You're being paranoid."
    KENTA: "What're you worried about?"
    TAKERU: "Nothing really. I just want to be sure if I decide to go back to getting a few nights of good, dreamless sleep again that Mr. Kunida won't be immediately over my shoulder."
    KENTA: "And by that you mean... not taking your prescriptions?"
    TAKERU: "That'd be the easiest solution, yeah."
    KENTA: "You can't just decide to do that on your own. You should talk to a doctor, or your point of contact at Mirako. That's not good thinking, Takeru. You should - "
    TAKERU: "I can decide for myself."
    KENTA: "You're not an expert. You can't do whatever you want just because you feel like it. You - "
    TAKERU: "Forget I mentioned it."
    KENTA: "Talk to someone at Mirako if you have an issue. Don't go doing weird things on your own."
    TAKERU: "Really, forget it."
    Between Kenta hounding me about my meds and the beat of the rain on the roof, it's a dreary morning.
    I regret mentioning anything to this guy, ever.
    Even if it's not Kunida staring over my shoulder, my roommate sure as hell is, as I eye those three bottles on the bathroom table.
    I shut the door.
    Maybe it's only one of these stupid things that keeps me seeing nonsense every night.
    If I'm honest with myself, I don't really see what was wrong with me from back before then, when the doctors at the sports clinic decided it was schizophrenia.
    Well, not the guys at the sports injury center. Those doctors just treated the broken arm, fractured ribs, and so on. And then when they were done passed me on the shrinks at the mental health clinic.
    I check the mirror.
    It's Takeru. A little underbuilt, a little too tall. Usually in a bad mood, and never comfortable with people, especially the people of Mirako. Who can tell that something's off.
    A year ago the Ichiro Takeru looking back at me would be charismatic, poised, ready to take on the world. Not the sort of person to beat himself up every morning in front a bucnh of bottle of pills.
    Was I "schizophrenic" even back then?
    Something's fake, I just can't tell what.
    KENTA: "Takeru, you need to hurry up or we're going to be late."
    TAKERU: "You know, it's not the worst thing in the world if we don't show up to school an hour before classes start."
    KENTA: "Of course not. The point is that even if we're delayed in our commute, there's still time to spare before we need to be at Mirako."
    TAKERU: "It's pouring out. I'll take the bus today."
    KENTA: "That just means the bus will be even more off-schedule! You realize Shizukawa is so small the bus only passes through three times a day?"
    KENTA: "You're really risking it."
    TAKERU: "I'll be fine. Just go on your own."
    KENTA: "You know, you're quite a difficult person to get along with."
    TAKERU: "Tell me about it."
    Somehow Kenta manages to drag me down to the common room, but I'm not biting on the whole walk-to-school thing today. I'd just be sitting there in homeroom for an extra half hour, probably wet too.
    Only a few are up this early, and there's no one sitting down or studying - most are running in and out of the kitchen, probably used to a warm breakfast. Not my style. I've just grabbed my usual fruit and toast by the time Kenta is already out the door.
    Out the door...
    The morning's still dull and gray, but it's light enough to tell that he's getting soaked out there.
    I run up the entryway and open the door. Outside the sound of the rain on the road is almost enough to drown out my shout.
    TAKERU: "Kenta! Hey!"
    KENTA: "Good morning?"
    TAKERU: "Aren't you forgetting your umbrella or something?"
    KENTA: "I don't own one."
    TAKERU: "By the time you get up the hill to Mirako you'll be so wet you'll start wrinkling up."
    KENTA: "Whether you're wrinkled or not doesn't have any effect at all on how you do at school."
    KENTA: "I don't mind being wet."
    TAKERU: "Yeah but what's everyone going to think of the guy who's dripping all over the floor?"
    TAKERU: "Kenta, you have your flashes of genius sometimes but most of the time, I swear..."
    TAKERU: "Do you even own an umbrella?"
    KENTA: "No."
    TAKERU: "Go figure..."
    TAKERU: "Come on. Let's go."
    KENTA: "You're coming?"
    TAKERU: "My umbrella's big enough for two."
    KENTA: "You don't need to."
    TAKERU: "You've been on my case the whole morning so I can at least return the favor."
    Kenta's more broad-shouldered than me, so he's probably still going to take some rain, but if his plan was to just hike to Mirako through this storm, he'd be at least half water weight by the time he showed up.
    Sometimes I wonder how he's even managed to survive this long on this earth.
    As I'm contemplating just what makes a person this bright in some areas and critically stupid in others, there's someone else by my side, running out of the rain.
    NATSUMI: "Hey, if it isn't Takeru. Kenta too!"
    TAKERU: "Natsumi? What're you doing - "
    NATSUMI: "I cancelled practice this morning. No way we'd get anything done in this weather."
    TAKERU: "I sort of meant... Why exactly are you... Here? Right beside us?"
    KENTA: "By design, umbrellas are made for one person. While Takeru was probably foolish for trying to use one for two people, a third person isn't - "
    NATSUMI: "Oh I loaned my umbrella to Tetsu last month when we had practice in the snow, and my coat is way out of fashion, really I wouldn't be caught dead wearing a raincoat, so I figured - "
    TAKERU: "You figured you'd ambush the first person to leave the dorms?"
    NATSUMI: "Basically. You're smart when you want to be, Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Not really. You're you just extremely easy to read."
    NATSUMI: "Hey! Even if I'm easy to read, I'm still dry today, right?"
    TAKERU: "..."
    NATSUMI: "Right?"
    TAKERU: "You both owe me, you hear? I'm going to put this down. Kenta: too weird to get an umbrella. Natsumi: same, but too lazy."
    KENTA: "Don't lump me in with her when she's the one that - "
    NATSUMI: "You're saying I'm as weird as Kenta, plus being lazy? That's harsh, Takeru. At least pick one when you - "
    KENTA: "I don't like what you're implying."
    NATSUMI: "Yeah? While I don't like..."
    TAKERU: "Dammit."
    I should've never done this.
    The entire walk to Mirako is these two bickering and sniping at each other all while shoulder-to-shoulder trying to shelter under me.
    And because we're now trying to squeeze three people under one umbrella, they're both catching stray rain when they forget to follow me and instead stand still to point at each other.
    Yeah. I really should've taken the bus.
    
    The rain doesn't let up as Meiko gives her daily report, and it's falling strong as ever all through Kunida's lecture.
    In fact, I think it's putting me to sleep. Either that or it's just sleep loss catching up with me.
    Looking around the room, no one but Meiko is really paying much attention either. Natsumi might as well be asleep with her eyes open. Hagami, head phones on, in the back... some unfixed point out the window has her attention.
    Hang on, since when did Hikari sit next to Hagami?
    I turn away.
    So this is one of the few classes where Hikari decided to show up. Fine. I guess that's normal, or as normal as it gets for Hikari.
    But then shouldn't Hagami have known who I was talking about? Even someone as closed off as Hagami couldn't go a month and a half not knowing the name of the severely delinquent girl sitting next to them... could they?
    Hikari sticks in my mind.
    I stop paying attention altogether. It seems bizarre to me to picture Hikari anywhere but downstairs in the school's forgotten rooms.
    Have I ever seen her outside the school? She must run into people if she took the bus in from out of town, right? Or if she lives in the dorms, wouldn't I see her walking around Shizukawa?
    Of course... if everyone treats her like a ghost... it wouldn't matter if they saw her not. They'd just pretend she was someone that didn't exist. And keep walking.
    When morning classes are over, I look over my shoulder again, but she's gone.
    NATSUMI: "Takeru! Are you even paying attention?"
    TAKERU: "No, I'm not. Stop jabbing me in the back."
    NATSUMI: "Come on, let's go find Kenta."
    TAKERU: "For what?"
    NATSUMI: "To get him to do the opposition research, obviously! Weren't you listening this morning?"
    TAKERU: "No."
    NATSUMI: "I need him to tap into his network of baseball nerds at our rivals in the district. I bet there's guys like Kenta across the country, keeping spreadsheets on even the lowliest highschool baseball teams."
    TAKERU: "I don't think even Kenta does that."
    NATSUMI: "He's not? Then you need to come help me get him to start!"
    MEIKO: "Natsumi, I know you keep your own numbers."
    NATSUMI: "Yeah but if I talk Kenta into it, then I don't have to. And I still need the enemy's info too!"
    MEIKO: "Why don't you do some networking yourself then?"
    NATSUMI: "Good idea. Meiko, you're like link number one in my network, so you'll be even more convincing to Kenta. Come help me!"
    MEIKO: "That's not quite what I - "
    TAKERU: "Later, guys, I've got places to be."
    MEIKO: "See you after lunch, Takeru."
    NATSUMI: "'Place to be?' Give me a break! Get back here."
    But the chatter in the hall drowns out her voice.
