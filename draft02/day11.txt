label day11:

    I wake with unpleasant memories of the previous night.
    Not memories exactly, more... sensations. I can't remember anything I saw, but there's some lingering ache all over. Not good.
    At least today I'm up on my own without any interference from Kenta. He might be off somewhere else, but in his place, a frog in a jar sits on the dresser.
    TAKERU: "He just keeps getting weirder..."
    Well, I guess it's a predictable weirdness. Better than half of the rest of Mirako's little mysteries.
    
    First mystery: What is up with that river?
    The rain from yesterday vanished in the night, leaving behind only clouds and a thin layer of dampness on the pavement of Shizukawa.
    But judging from the river itself, yesterday never happened. The thing hardly looks like's it's moving, let alone rose at all. Isn't that what rivers are supposed to do after a storm?
    The still water, that ruin just behind the trees... Suspicious. Mystery number one.
    
    Back to homeroom.
    MEIKO: "...And the student council is pleased to announce that we'll have double the space for student-run stands this year, and hopefully more room for food stalls and independent sellers from the Shizukawa area."
    MEIKO: "If you're interested, let me know and we can add your name to the permit list. The festival is coming up faster than you think, so plan ahead."
    Back to homeroom, and Meiko's daily announcements.
    TAKERU: "Coming up fast? I thought it was still weeks off..."
    TAKERU: "What kind of weird school has a cultural festival this early in the year anyway?"
    TAKERU: "I said, 'what kind of school...'"
    NATSUMI: "..."
    TAKERU: "Natsumi?"
    NATSUMI: "Hmph."
    TAKERU: "Oh, what now?"
    NATSUMI: "Hey Tsuji, isn't this an interesting speech from our class rep?"
    STUDENT: "What? Oh, captain Natsumi. A speech?"
    NATSUMI: "Yeah, Meiko made a breakthrough with the festival or something yesterday. I was trying to listen but I think a ghost spoke over me."
    STUDENT: "Uhm, right, captain."
    TAKERU: "Very funny, Natsumi."
    NATSUMI: "There it goes again!"
    NATSUMI: "Sounded like a ghost for sure! A ghost that refuses to say they're sorry for calling me a liar yesterday."
    TAKERU: "I didn't call you a liar. What're you even - "
    TAKERU: "Oh. Hikari? Are you talking about Hikari?"
    NATSUMI: "Huh?"
    TAKERU: "In the back. Her."
    NATSUMI: "That's an empty desk, genius."
    Sure enough, in the back row, there's an empty desk next to the tuned-out Hagami.
    TAKERU: "Yeah, she doesn't show up some days. That doesn't make her a new student every time she shows up."
    TAKERU: "If you want to keep pretending that you - "
    NATSUMI: "See, that's it! There you go again. I'm not pretending anything. You're the one pretending that I'm pretending not to see people that you're pretending exist but in your pretend little - "
    TAKERU: "Knock it off."
    Mystery number two: what is up with Natsumi and Hikari?
    Or, what is up with Meiko and Hikari? She starts getting all shifty-eyed too whenever I mention Hikari. Didn't Natsumi try to tell me to drop the whole 'Hikari thing' when it came to Meiko?"
    And Kunida won't be level with me either?
    NATSUMI: "Did you zone out there or what?"
    TAKERU: "I was just thinking."
    TAKERU: "Besides, weren't you supposed to be the one ignoring me?"
    NATSUMI: "What? Oh, yeah. Tsuji, did you hear something?"
    NATSUMI: "Tsuji? Hey! I'm talking to you. Don't ignore your captain."
    Which brings us to Mystery 2.5: why do I spend any of my time at all trying talk to Natsumi?
    MEIKO: "Hello Natsumi, Takeru. Good morning."
    NATSUMI: "Oh, it's Meiko! You finished talking."
    MEIKO: "...Yes? Weren't you paying attention?"
    TAKERU: "She was too busy trying to pay negative attention me to notice anything else going on."
    MEIKO: "Negative attention?"
    NATSUMI: "Takeru is the center of the universe so if someone's not listening to his weird opinions, smoke starts pouring out his ears."
    MEIKO: "What's this about?"
    NATSUMI: "Ahaha, nothing. I'm just joking around with my old pal. Or new pal, I guess."
    NATSUMI: "Isn't that right, new pal?"
    TAKERU: "Ow, you don't have to elbow me so hard."
    NATSUMI: "Sorry, you're just the sort of person I'm pretty sure doesn't get subtlety at all."
    TAKERU: "Actual subtle people wouldn't try to bruise my kidneys every time they wanted to prove a point."
    MEIKO: "Shh! Mr. Kunida is here."
    Right. I shut up.
    But Natsumi elbows again below the ribs for good measure. That idiot.
    She's grinning like a stooge but I still have no idea how to interpret this. Is she still trying to caution me against mentioning the whole Hikari thing to Meiko? Or is she just deranged?
    Or planning something else?
    Funny how it's the team captains that always give off that megalomaniac air but with Jun I'm not sure if he was ever like that or if my perspective was skewed seeing as how after the fact I can't be sure if - 
    If...
    I glance backwards: Hagami, staring at the window, then also, sitting there... Hikari staring at nothing.
    Then at Natsumi, still making some stupid face at me even as Kunida recaps some obscure math fact from the earlier test.
    TAKERU: "..."
    Am I just destined to be enemies with baseball captains, no matter what the school or setting?
    Why does everything have to be so complicated?
    
    When the lunch hour arrives, Natsumi again makes another pointed attempt to elbow me before heading off to the cafeteria with the baseball crowd. Not that I mind.
    Meiko has the usual group around her, students looking for answers about homework, the festival, life in general...
    I stand up to leave for the old library when I notice someone standing next to me.
    HIKARI: "I heard you this morning."
    TAKERU: "Hikari? You startled me."
    HIKARI: "That's because you never pay attention to what's going on around you. If you did, you might've noticed I was listening."
    TAKERU: "Listening to me what? What're you talking about?"
    HIKARI: "Why was that girl talking about me? The one with the baseball hat."
    TAKERU: "Natsumi?"
    TAKERU: "I mean, she ran into you yesterday, didn't she? I might've given her a hard time over it... She pretended not to know you and all..."
    HIKARI: "That's normal for me."
    HIKARI: "You have to learn that that's just the way things are here."
    I stare at the door as the last baseball player, that guy Tsuji, leaves the room.
    TAKERU: "You can't blame me for at least being concerned, right? Isn't that the least I be doing? As a friend?"
    Then when I look back beside me, she's gone.
    TAKERU: "Stop appearing and disappearing out of nowhere..."
    MEIKO: "Takeru?"
    TAKERU: "Uah!"
    MEIKO: "Sorry to startle you. You're alright?"
    TAKERU: "Fine, yeah. Have you seen..."
    I glance around the room but I can't find Hikari. The most I get is a pack of confused stares from Meiko's little group.
    ...I've got to get out of here.
    TAKERU: "Never mind. See you after lunch."
    MEIKO: "Yeah... See you later."
    It doesn't take a genius to see that look of concern on her face. I'd be an idiot not to see it. Of course she thinks I'm nuts. Standing there in class, talking to a gap in the air where Hikari used to -
    Used to be...?
    Maybe...
    There's a way that this whole thing makes sense, even if I don't want to admit it.
    I head for the old library. Need to stop my brain from spinning. If Hikari...
    Maybe I'm the one seeing things and everyone else is just...
    What am I talking about? Of course there's such a person as "Hikari." I'm not so far off the deep end that I can see that. I'm medicated for chrissakes. That's supposed to prevent this stuff.
    Time to get out of here.
    
    But up on the second floor, in the disused wing... The gray of the old library doesn't give me much consolation.
    For the third day in a row I'm the first one here, with only scattered manga and the antique radio for company.
    Maybe Mana's still out sick? Hagami should be here at least though?
    Whatever.
    It's at least better than being within eyesight of Natsumi and her little gang. I find a place to sit at the central table. Mystery 2.501: how does this pile of dreck keep growing even when Mana's not here?
    Clearing off the loose paper and books, I find a seat, and... wait.
    And... keep waiting?
    Looks like I'm eating alone today.
    There's a cloud over the picture window. After ten minutes the library is still gray, with no signs of life but me in the corner.
    ...Kind of pathetic. But I don't really mind.
    Without anything else to do, I flip open volume #13 of "My Rose-colored Life (even though I'm already dead!!)"
    The lead girl stands alone in the school courtyard, even as all her former friends wander around her.
    I want to laugh at the next panel, where she's yelling "why doesn't anybody see me!?" but...
    When you start relating to a shoujo manga protagonist... Things have gotten pretty dire.
    TAKERU: "Who even reads this stuff? Worthless."
    I stuff Rose-colored Life #13 under a pile of similar pulp and search for something less depressing.
    What did I read back in Tohoku? Sports fiction? Not really...
    I didn't read anything.
    Maybe that's why I feel lost -- there's a million different books in here and I'm such a burnout that nothing even appeals to me any more.
    Instead I just push 'play' on the radio.
    ...in response, nothing happens.
    TAKERU: "This stupid thing."
    What's the point of keeping this antique around if it doesn't even work?
    I eject the current tape and push it back in again. The instant that it's out, I catch a glimpse of the title, printed on the side of the tape.
    Something like... 1990: Keiji Inori/Naomi, Elgar concerto. Which wouldn't ring a bell for me at all, but that's Hagami's family name, right? Keiji?
    The sound of the piano with strings and orchestra behind it starts from the speakers. Guess the radio isn't busted as I thought after all.
    What was it I was thinking yesterday? That Hagami wanted to perform some musical piece for the festival?
    Well, if the tape is marked 1990... That's fifteen years ago. It couldn't be her on this recording.
    Just another coincidence.
    I hate these coincidences. A year ago there was no such thing. After pushing all the buttons at random I finally stop the tape and the radio shuts up.
    It's been almost half an hour. Pretty clearly, no one else is coming, and I'm done with my lunch.
    Without anything else to do, I leave the dusty old library and head for the dusty old hallway below.
    
    TAKERU: "Hikari?"
    TAKERU: "Hey! Hikari?"
    I slide open one door after the other.
    Storage, a few haphazard desks, more storage, a room empty of everything but dust floating into the air as the door slams open...
    This wing. There's nothing down here? I could've sword the tea room was the first on the left, but I'm having trouble remembering where to find Hikari's usual hangout.
    Is this my punishment for wondering if she actually...
    Actually...
    TAKERU: "Don't think it, don't think it..."
    Actually...
    TAKERU: "Ahhh!! What're you - "
    TAKERU: "Who - ? What - ?"
    HAGAMI: "Eep!"
    That someone who just dove behind a row of crates... wasn't Hikari, was it? And they weren't some ghost either.
    TAKERU: "Sorry Hagami. I was looking for a friend of mine."
    HAGAMI: "No that's... fine.":
    She takes her place back on a stool in the corner of this small room. The wall on my left is dominated by a stack of storage crates, while the wall at the right...
    There's an upright piano set there, next to a stool.
    Hagami, clinging to it -- I'd say her heartrate's about triple the usual.
    TAKERU: "I didn't mean to scare you. I was looking for Hikari, I swear."
    HAGAMI: "Okay."
    TAKERU: "I'll leave you to whatever you... I guess you wanted privacy down here."
    HAGAMI: "Sorry."
    TAKERU: "No, I'm the one who should apologize. Mana is out today so you..."
    So you decided that instead of going through another day like yesterday, you'd hole up here in the basement.
    Right. She's...
    TAKERU: "...avoiding me. That's fine."
    TAKERU: "I don't imagine it's all that fun spending your lunch time with me alone."
    HAGAMI: "Please, I don't..."
    TAKERU: "It's fine, really."
    TAKERU: "Isn't it time we got back to class? Lunch is almost over, right?"
    HAGAMI: "Right..."
    HAGAMI: "Mana should be back tomorrow, so..."
    TAKERU: "Tell her 'get well' from me, okay?"
    HAGAMI: "Okay."
    I could keep trying to keep our conversation natural but it's clear I'd be the only one trying.
    I mean, I sort of get it. I'm not the most personable person ever. Even I wouldn't want to deal with myself one-on-one for too long.
    But I can't shake that pain somewhere below my gut, that everyone goes out of their way now to skip their time with me, rather than to come seek me out.
    Was it really that long ago that I shrugged off the freshmen that wanted to eat with me, always asking questions, what's Takeru's training regime, what do you do on the weekend, should I try your diet or -
    TAKERU: "Shake it off."
    Chemistry is next. Rid yourself of these useless thoughts, and let's get to work.
    
    Right. Chemistry.
    The lab's on the first floor, so up one flight of stairs, around two bends and through the main hall, and -
    And I have this class with Hagami. Who's walking next to me. Who I just managed to embarass by finding her hiding out in the old wing.
    If this is uncomfortable for me, it's nothing compared to Hagami, who's trying so hard not to look at me I could almost laugh.
    TAKERU: "So, you're really planning on performing something for the school festival?"
    HAGAMI: "Huh? Performing?"
    TAKERU: "Something on the piano I guess?"
    HAGAMI: "Oh, um... I thought you said you wouldn't look at my form."
    TAKERU: "Oh, I didn't, but it's pretty hard not to get some ideas if you're ducking behind pianos and handing me books on music theory."
    HAGAMI: "Oh... Hm."
    TAKERU: "And I may have caught a glimpse at the festival application."
    TAKERU: "But you can't be mad about that. If you're going to perform in front of everyone, you can't really keep that a secret, right?"
    HAGAMi: "..."
    TAKERU: "Or were you only planning to reveal this
