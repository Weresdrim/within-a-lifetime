label day11:

    I wake with unpleasant memories of the previous night.
    Not memories exactly, more... sensations. I can't remember anything I saw, but there's some lingering ache all over. Not good.
    At least today I'm up on my own without any interference from Kenta. He might be off somewhere else, but in his place, a frog in a jar sits on the dresser.
    TAKERU: "He just keeps getting weirder..."
    Well, I guess it's a predictable weirdness. Better than half of the rest of Mirako's little mysteries.
    
    First mystery: What is up with that river?
    The rain from yesterday vanished in the night, leaving behind only clouds and a thin layer of dampness on the pavement of Shizukawa.
    But judging from the river itself, yesterday never happened. The thing hardly looks like's it's moving, let alone rose at all. Isn't that what rivers are supposed to do after a storm?
    The still water, that ruin just behind the trees... Suspicious. Mystery number one.
    
    Back to homeroom.
    MEIKO: "...And the student council is pleased to announce that we'll have double the space for student-run stands this year, and hopefully more room for food stalls and independant sellers from the Shizukawa area."
    MEIKO: "If you're interested, let me know and we can add your name to the permit list. The festival is coming up faster than you think, so plan ahead."
    Back to homeroom, and Meiko's daily announcements.
    TAKERU: "Coming up fast? I thought it was still weeks off..."
    TAKERU: "What kind of weird school has a cultural festival this early in the year anyway?"
    TAKERU: "I said, 'what kind of school...'"
    NATSUMI: "..."
    TAKERU: "Natsumi?"
    NATSUMI: "Hmph."
    TAKERU: "Oh, what now?"
    NATSUMI: "Hey Tsuji, isn't this an interesting speech from our class rep?"
    STUDENT: "What? Oh, captain Natsumi. A speech?"
    NATSUMI: "Yeah, Meiko made a breakthrough with the festival or something yesterday. I was trying to listen but I think a ghost spoke over me."
    STUDENT: "Uhm, right, captain."
    TAKERU: "Very funny, Natsumi."
    NATSUMI: "There it goes again!"
    NATSUMI: "Sounded like a ghost for sure! A ghost that refuses to say they're sorry for calling me a liar yesterday."
    TAKERU: "I didn't call you a liar. What're you even - "
    TAKERU: "Oh. Hikari? Are you talking about Hikari?"
    NATSUMI: "Huh?"
    TAKERU: "In the back. Her."
    NATSUMI: "That's an empty desk, genius."
    Sure enough, in the back row, there's an empty desk next to the tuned-out Hagami.
    TAKERU: "Yeah, she doesn't show up some days. That doesn't make her a new student every times she shows up."
    TAKERU: "If you want to keep pretending that you - "
    NATSUMI: "See, that's it! There you go again. I'm not pretending anything. You're the one pretending that I'm pretending not to see people that you're pretending exist but in your pretend little - "
    TAKERU: "Knock it off."
    Mystery number two: what is up with Natsumi and Hikari?
    Or, what is up with Meiko and Hikari? She starts getting all shifty-eyed too whenever I mention Hikari. Didn't Natsumi try to tell me to drop the whole 'Hikari thing' when it came to Meiko?"
    And Kunida won't be level with me either?
    NATSUMI: "Did you zone out there or what?"
    TAKERU: "I was just thinking."
    TAKERU: "Besides, weren't you supposed to be the one ignoring me?"
    NATSUMI: "What? Oh, yeah. Tsuji, did you hear something?"
    NATSUMI: "Tsuji? Hey! I'm talking to you. Don't ignore your captain."
    Which brings us to Mystery 2.5: why do I spend any of my time at all trying to make sense out of Natsumi?
