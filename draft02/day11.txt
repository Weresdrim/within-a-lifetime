label day11:

    I wake with unpleasant memories of the previous night.
    Not memories exactly, more... sensations. I can't remember anything I saw, but there's some lingering ache all over. Not good.
    At least today I'm up on my own without any interference from Kenta. He might be off somewhere else, but in his place, a frog in a jar sits on the dresser.
    TAKERU: "He just keeps getting weirder..."
    Well, I guess it's a predictable weirdness. Better than half of the rest of Mirako's little mysteries.
    
    First mystery: What is up with that river?
    The rain from yesterday vanished in the night, leaving behind only clouds and a thin layer of dampness on the pavement of Shizukawa.
    But judging from the river itself, yesterday never happened. The thing hardly looks like's it's moving, let alone rose at all. Isn't that what rivers are supposed to do after a storm?
    The still water, that ruin just behind the trees... Suspicious. Mystery number one.
    
    Back to homeroom.
    MEIKO: "...And the student council is pleased to announce that we'll have double the space for student-run stands this year, and hopefully more room for food stalls and independent sellers from the Shizukawa area."
    MEIKO: "If you're interested, let me know and we can add your name to the permit list. The festival is coming up faster than you think, so plan ahead."
    Back to homeroom, and Meiko's daily announcements.
    TAKERU: "Coming up fast? I thought it was still weeks off..."
    TAKERU: "What kind of weird school has a cultural festival this early in the year anyway?"
    TAKERU: "I said, 'what kind of school...'"
    NATSUMI: "..."
    TAKERU: "Natsumi?"
    NATSUMI: "Hmph."
    TAKERU: "Oh, what now?"
    NATSUMI: "Hey Tsuji, isn't this an interesting speech from our class rep?"
    STUDENT: "What? Oh, captain Natsumi. A speech?"
    NATSUMI: "Yeah, Meiko made a breakthrough with the festival or something yesterday. I was trying to listen but I think a ghost spoke over me."
    STUDENT: "Uhm, right, captain."
    TAKERU: "Very funny, Natsumi."
    NATSUMI: "There it goes again!"
    NATSUMI: "Sounded like a ghost for sure! A ghost that refuses to say they're sorry for calling me a liar yesterday."
    TAKERU: "I didn't call you a liar. What're you even - "
    TAKERU: "Oh. Hikari? Are you talking about Hikari?"
    NATSUMI: "Huh?"
    TAKERU: "In the back. Her."
    NATSUMI: "That's an empty desk, genius."
    Sure enough, in the back row, there's an empty desk next to the tuned-out Hagami.
    TAKERU: "Yeah, she doesn't show up some days. That doesn't make her a new student every time she shows up."
    TAKERU: "If you want to keep pretending that you - "
    NATSUMI: "See, that's it! There you go again. I'm not pretending anything. You're the one pretending that I'm pretending not to see people that you're pretending exist but in your pretend little - "
    TAKERU: "Knock it off."
    Mystery number two: what is up with Natsumi and Hikari?
    Or, what is up with Meiko and Hikari? She starts getting all shifty-eyed too whenever I mention Hikari. Didn't Natsumi try to tell me to drop the whole 'Hikari thing' when it came to Meiko?"
    And Kunida won't be level with me either?
    NATSUMI: "Did you zone out there or what?"
    TAKERU: "I was just thinking."
    TAKERU: "Besides, weren't you supposed to be the one ignoring me?"
    NATSUMI: "What? Oh, yeah. Tsuji, did you hear something?"
    NATSUMI: "Tsuji? Hey! I'm talking to you. Don't ignore your captain."
    Which brings us to Mystery 2.5: why do I spend any of my time at all trying talk to Natsumi?
    MEIKO: "Hello Natsumi, Takeru. Good morning."
    NATSUMI: "Oh, it's Meiko! You finished talking."
    MEIKO: "...Yes? Weren't you paying attention?"
    TAKERU: "She was too busy trying to pay negative attention me to notice anything else going on."
    MEIKO: "Negative attention?"
    NATSUMI: "Takeru is the center of the universe so if someone's not listening to his weird opinions, smoke starts pouring out his ears."
    MEIKO: "What's this about?"
    NATSUMI: "Ahaha, nothing. I'm just joking around with my old pal. Or new pal, I guess."
    NATSUMI: "Isn't that right, new pal?"
    TAKERU: "Ow, you don't have to elbow me so hard."
    NATSUMI: "Sorry, you're just the sort of person I'm pretty sure doesn't get subtlety at all."
    TAKERU: "Actual subtle people wouldn't try to bruise my kidneys every time they wanted to prove a point."
    MEIKO: "Shh! Mr. Kunida is here."
    Right. I shut up.
    But Natsumi elbows again below the ribs for good measure. That idiot.
    She's grinning like a stooge but I still have no idea how to interpret this. Is she still trying to caution me against mentioning the whole Hikari thing to Meiko? Or is she just deranged?
    Or planning something else?
    Funny how it's the team captains that always give off that megalomaniac air but with Jun I'm not sure if he was ever like that or if my perspective was skewed seeing as how after the fact I can't be sure if - 
    If...
    I glance backwards: Hagami, staring at the window, then also, sitting there... Hikari staring at nothing.
    Then at Natsumi, still making some stupid face at me even as Kunida recaps some obscure math fact from the earlier test.
    TAKERU: "..."
    Am I just destined to be enemies with baseball captains, no matter what the school or setting?
    Why does everything have to be so complicated?
    
    When the lunch hour arrives, Natsumi again makes another pointed attempt to elbow me before heading off to the cafeteria with the baseball crowd. Not that I mind.
    Meiko has the usual group around her, students looking for answers about homework, the festival, life in general...
    I stand up to leave for the old library when I notice someone standing next to me.
    HIKARI: "I heard you this morning."
    TAKERU: "Hikari? You startled me."
    HIKARI: "That's because you never pay attention to what's going on around you. If you did, you might've noticed I was listening."
    TAKERU: "Listening to me what? What're you talking about?"
    HIKARI: "Why was that girl talking about me? The one with the baseball hat."
    TAKERU: "Natsumi?"
    TAKERU: "I mean, she ran into you yesterday, didn't she? I might've given her a hard time over it... She pretended not to know you and all..."
    HIKARI: "That's normal for me."
    HIKARI: "You have to learn that that's just the way things are here."
    I stare at the door as the last baseball player, that guy Tsuji, leaves the room.
    TAKERU: "You can't blame me for at least being concerned, right? Isn't that the least I be doing? As a friend?"
    Then when I look back beside me, she's gone.
    TAKERU: "Stop appearing and disappearing out of nowhere..."
    MEIKO: "Takeru?"
    TAKERU: "Uah!"
    MEIKO: "Sorry to startle you. You're alright?"
    TAKERU: "Fine, yeah. Have you seen..."
    I glance around the room but I can't find Hikari. The most I get is a pack of confused stares from Meiko's little group.
    ...I've got to get out of here.
    TAKERU: "Never mind. See you after lunch."
    MEIKO: "Yeah... See you later."
    It doesn't take a genius to see that look of concern on her face. I'd be an idiot not to see it. Of course she thinks I'm nuts. Standing there in class, talking to a gap in the air where Hikari used to -
    Used to be...?
    Maybe...
    There's a way that this whole thing makes sense, even if I don't want to admit it.
    I head for the old library. Need to stop my brain from spinning. If Hikari...
    Maybe I'm the one seeing things and everyone else is just...
    What am I talking about? Of course there's such a person as "Hikari." I'm not so far off the deep end that I can see that. I'm medicated for chrissakes. That's supposed to prevent this stuff.
    Time to get out of here.
    
    But up on the second floor, in the disused wing... The gray of the old library doesn't give me much consolation.
    For the third day in a row I'm the first one here, with only scattered manga and the antique radio for company.
    Maybe Mana's still out sick? Hagami should be here at least though?
    Whatever.
    It's at least better than being within eyesight of Natsumi and her little gang. I find a place to sit at the central table. Mystery 2.501: how does this pile of dreck keep growing even when Mana's not here?
    Clearing off the loose paper and books, I find a seat, and... wait.
    And... keep waiting?
    Looks like I'm eating alone today.
    There's a cloud over the picture window. After ten minutes the library is still gray, with no signs of life but me in the corner.
    ...Kind of pathetic. But I don't really mind.
    Without anything else to do, I flip open volume #13 of "My Rose-colored Life (even though I'm already dead!!)"
    The lead girl stands alone in the school courtyard, even as all her former friends wander around her.
    I want to laugh at the next panel, where she's yelling "why doesn't anybody see me!?" but...
    When you start relating to a shoujo manga protagonist... Things have gotten pretty dire.
    TAKERU: "Who even reads this stuff? Worthless."
    I stuff Rose-colored Life #13 under a pile of similar pulp and search for something less depressing.
    What did I read back in Tohoku? Sports fiction? Not really...
    I didn't read anything.
    Maybe that's why I feel lost -- there's a million different books in here and I'm such a burnout that nothing even appeals to me any more.
    Instead I just push 'play' on the radio.
    ...in response, nothing happens.
    TAKERU: "This stupid thing."
    What's the point of keeping this antique around if it doesn't even work?
    I eject the current tape and push it back in again. The instant that it's out, I catch a glimpse of the title, printed on the side of the tape.
    Something like... 1990: Keiji Inori/Naomi, Elgar concerto. Which wouldn't ring a bell for me at all, but that's Hagami's family name, right? Keiji?
    The sound of the piano with strings and orchestra behind it starts from the speakers. Guess the radio isn't busted as I thought after all.
    What was it I was thinking yesterday? That Hagami wanted to perform some musical piece for the festival?
    Well, if the tape is marked 1990... That's fifteen years ago. It couldn't be her on this recording.
    Just another coincidence.
    I hate these coincidences. A year ago there was no such thing. After pushing all the buttons at random I finally stop the tape and the radio shuts up.
    It's been almost half an hour. Pretty clearly, no one else is coming, and I'm done with my lunch.
    Without anything else to do, I leave the dusty old library and head for the dusty old hallway below.
    
    TAKERU: "Hikari?"
    TAKERU: "Hey! Hikari?"
    I slide open one door after the other.
    Storage, a few haphazard desks, more storage, a room empty of everything but dust floating into the air as the door slams open...
    This wing. There's nothing down here? I could've sword the tea room was the first on the left, but I'm having trouble remembering where to find Hikari's usual hangout.
    Is this my punishment for wondering if she actually...
    Actually...
    TAKERU: "Don't think it, don't think it..."
    Actually...
    TAKERU: "Ahhh!! What're you - "
    TAKERU: "Who - ? What - ?"
    HAGAMI: "Eep!"
    That someone who just dove behind a row of crates... wasn't Hikari, was it? And they weren't some ghost either.
    TAKERU: "Sorry Hagami. I was looking for a friend of mine."
    HAGAMI: "No that's... fine.":
    She takes her place back on a stool in the corner of this small room. The wall on my left is dominated by a stack of storage crates, while the wall at the right...
    There's an upright piano set there, next to a stool.
    Hagami, clinging to it -- I'd say her heartrate's about triple the usual.
    TAKERU: "I didn't mean to scare you. I was looking for Hikari, I swear."
    HAGAMI: "Okay."
    TAKERU: "I'll leave you to whatever you... I guess you wanted privacy down here."
    HAGAMI: "Sorry."
    TAKERU: "No, I'm the one who should apologize. Mana is out today so you..."
    So you decided that instead of going through another day like yesterday, you'd hole up here in the basement.
    Right. She's...
    TAKERU: "...avoiding me. That's fine."
    TAKERU: "I don't imagine it's all that fun spending your lunch time with me alone."
    HAGAMI: "Please, I don't..."
    TAKERU: "It's fine, really."
    TAKERU: "Isn't it time we got back to class? Lunch is almost over, right?"
    HAGAMI: "Right..."
    HAGAMI: "Mana should be back tomorrow, so..."
    TAKERU: "Tell her 'get well' from me, okay?"
    HAGAMI: "Okay."
    I could keep trying to keep our conversation natural but it's clear I'd be the only one trying.
    I mean, I sort of get it. I'm not the most personable person ever. Even I wouldn't want to deal with myself one-on-one for too long.
    But I can't shake that pain somewhere below my gut, that everyone goes out of their way now to skip their time with me, rather than to come seek me out.
    Was it really that long ago that I shrugged off the freshmen that wanted to eat with me, always asking questions, what's Takeru's training regime, what do you do on the weekend, should I try your diet or -
    TAKERU: "Shake it off."
    Chemistry is next. Rid yourself of these useless thoughts, and let's get to work.
    
    Right. Chemistry.
    The lab's on the third floor, so up one flight of stairs, around two bends and through the main hall, and -
    And I have this class with Hagami. Who's walking next to me. Who I just managed to embarass by finding her hiding out in the old wing.
    If this is uncomfortable for me, it's nothing compared to Hagami, who's trying so hard not to look at me I could almost laugh.
    But I don't. We file into the lab late, after the still-pouting Natsumi, even. Guess I was right -- we were late at lunch after all.
    ...which means the only seat remaining is in the very back.
    ...which is next to the second-to-last seat remaining, also in the very, next to the second-to-last person to class.
    TAKERU: "So er... I guess we're working together today?"
    HAGAMI: "Ah."
    HAGAMI: "Yes. Lab partners."
    TAKERU: "Hey, look, I'm sorry I walked in on whatever it was you were doing down there. Let's just try and get through chem, and then it's only English and we can go home. Right?"
    No response.
    Hagami's fishing around in her bag, and finally... she comes up with those damn headphones.
    If she can hear me now, she's pretending not to.
    ...I must've really annoyed her earlier. But everyone else around us is bustling around trying to set up for the day's lab, and there's not really any time to dwell on it.
    
    But as the hour drags on, I really wish I'd addressed this problem sooner.
    Turns out, when you're a month behind everyone else on the curriculum, and your partner's intentionally made herself deaf, a chemistry lab is really tough.
    I'm still trying to figure out how to turn the burner on without injuring myself (unsuccessfully - I probably won't feel my left ring finger for days) while in the meantime, Hagami's already writing some sort of report?
    I look at the burner again.
    Then massage the fingerpads on my left hand.
    Yep, that settles it, time to sacrifice my pride.
    TAKERU: "Hey, Hagami?"
    TAKERU: "I know you can hear me. I'm embarassing myself already so don't make me peel those headphones off."
    HAGAMI: "Hm?"
    TAKERU: "I've been in this class all of three times and I don't have any idea what I'm doing, so if you want me to help at all, you're going to have to show me the ropes."
    TAKERU: "And what're you writing?"
    HAGAMI: "The lab report."
    TAKERU: "Isn't that supposed to come after actually doing the lab?"
    HAGAMI: "If I already know what's going to happen... then why bother heating with mixing, and heating, and that..."
    HAGAMI: "I'll just write the report and you can do the lab."
    TAKERU: "Wait, hang on, don't put those back on. You already know how this is going to turn out? I've been burning myself for the past half hour for nothing?"
    HAGAMI: "...It's simple. You really didn't know what... What would happen?"
    TAKERU: "No?"
    TAKERU: "Why does everyone here seem to be some sort of mini-genius..."
    HAGAMI: "Well... It is called a school for the gifted."
    TAKERU: "If we're talking about this kind of gifted, then they can save me some trouble and kick me out already."
    HAGAMI: "...And also we did this same thing at my last school."
    TAKERU: "Oh. That makes more sense then... Maybe I don't have to go take my name off the student register."
    HAGAMI: "No... Nothing like that."
    TAKERU: "How should I help, then?"
    HAGAMI: "Just... pretend to do the lab. So nothing seems suspicious."
    TAKERU: "Oh I can do that just fine. Faking is a good skill to have, especially if you're in a sport with an umpire."
    TAKERU: "I didn't expect you'd be on board with skipping an entire lab though... Isn't this supposed to last us the rest of the month?"
    HAGAMI: "It'll last everyone else a week or two... Yes."
    TAKERU: "You know, you can look pretty timid, but you can be really brazen when you want to be. This is some Nastumi levels of underhandedness."
    Hagami doesn't reply, but she does turn an appealing shade of red as she tries to hide a smile.
    I guess I should've known behind that face there's something mischevious... She's been trying to pull one over on me since day one.
    The rest of class I spend flicking the burner on and off, watching the flame shoot up and fall back. I wish I'd stopped trying to do this honestly earlier... It'd mean I could still feel all ten fingers rather than the nine I'm working with.
    Everyone else in class looks like they're having as much trouble as I was. Nastumi is arguing with one of the guys I recognize as a pitcher, while their solution smokes behind them. Smoke seems to be the norm, today. Except for at Meiko's station of course. Where she appears to already be done.
    I still feel kind of useless though... Even if our group has no real work to do, it's still up to Hagami to write the report.
    TAKERU: "Hey."
    HAGAMI: "..."
    TAKERU: "I won't mention to Mana or anyone that you were down practicing in that old piano room. You don't have to worry about it."
    HAGAMI: "...Thanks."
    TAKERU: "I guess I just hadn't realized you were performing at the festival."
    HAGAMI: "Huh? Performing?"
    TAKERU: "Something on the piano I guess?"
    HAGAMI: "Oh, um... I thought you said you wouldn't look at my form."
    TAKERU: "Oh, I didn't, but it's pretty hard not to get some ideas if you're ducking behind pianos and handing me books on music theory."
    HAGAMI: "Oh... Hm."
    TAKERU: "And also yeah I may have caught a glimpse at the festival application."
    TAKERU: "But you can't be mad about that. If you're going to perform in front of everyone, you can't really keep that a secret, right?"
    HAGAMI: "..."
    TAKERU: "Or were you only going to say anything on the actual day of the festival? Perform behind a curtain or something?"
    HAGAMI: "..."
    TAKERU: "Hey, don't put on headphones if I'm sitting right here talking to - "
    TAKERU: "I guess I'm just talking to myself now."
    It takes a few more tries, but I finally get the hang of starting up the burner without risking my fingers.
    At this point there's no real need to do any work, but I more feel like an idiot that I couldn't get this basic piece of equipment working in the first place.
    Or more I feel like and idiot because I'm obviously getting on the nerves of the person bailing me out of this lab. Maybe I understand why Hagami would try to avoid me.
    
    By the time class is over, Hagami has filled almost a full four pages of her lab notebook. I've managed to sear the outline of a propane flame into my retinas. All in all, a productive hour.
    When everyone starts filing out the lab back to homeroom, I lose track of Hagami. Strange, Hikari doesn't seem to be here either.
    I'm resigned to walking in silence when there's someone at my side.
    MEIKO: "Hey Takeru. How you'd enjoy the lab?"
    TAKERU: "Oh, er, it was alright."
    MEIKO: "You didn't have any trouble with the setup at Mirako? We've had a few safety courses this year that I know missed, but it really didn't slow you down?"
    TAKERU: "No?"
    I rub my ring finger. No, no it didn't slow me down, but it should have.
    MEIKO: "That's great. You must be talented. Do you have an interest in applied sciences?"
    TAKERU: "Applied... science? I'm not sure what you mean."
    MEIKO: "As a career, I mean. Or are you thinking about physical sciences in general, maybe?"
    TAKERU: "I can't say I've really, er..."
    I would've preferred silence. While I know Meiko's trying to be welcoming or encouraging or something, whenever she talks like this, it just reinforces that feeling that I'm in way over my head.
    Half of the programs and careers and disciplines that she brings up, I can't even understand.
    Those are my thoughts as I sit through English. That I'm out of place and stuck here. And I don't deserve people like Meiko, who go out of their way for me.
    What did she ever see in me when we were kids?
    I'd normally be tempted to keep slipping off into my own self-absorbed little world, but a tempting target brings me back: the exposed rib of Natsumi.
    NATSUMI: "Ow! Hey!"
    TAKERU: "You were dozing off."
    NATSUMI: "So were you!"
    TAKERU: "I wasn't drooling on my desk."
    NATSUMI: "Neither was I!"
    MEIKO: "Shhh!"
    NATSUMI: "Sorry, sorry!"
    Mission accomplished. Natsumi doesn't drift off after that, but judging by her scowl that's only because she's planning her revenge.
    But I make it to the end of the day unscathed. No bruising to the kidneys, no vicious verbal assault, just a glare and a nod from Natsumi as she heads out the door.
    NATSUMI: "Bye Meiko, take it easy."
    MEIKO: "Enjoy your practice."
    NATSUMI: "I will."
    NATSUMI: "And Takeru..."
    NATSUMI: "You're good. But watch out. I'm better."
    NATSUMI: "See you!"
    TAKERU: "Bye?"
    MEIKO: "What's that about?"
    TAKERU: "She's mad that I care that she's going to flunk out of Mirako."
    MEIKO: "I'm... not sure that's quite it, but..."
    TAKERU: "Oh well."
    MEIKO: "Hey, I'd love to stay and maybe go over some of the next round of festival preperations with you today, but there's a council meeting that I need to sit for."
    TAKERU: "It's no problem."
    MEIKO: "You're welcome to come, I think, I mean, I don't think anyone would have a problem if I said you're with me, so if you'd like - "
    TAKERU: "That's fine. You do way more than you should for me already."
    And I definitely don't want to be sitting in as Meiko's charity case, on a student council meeting, or anywhere else for that matter.
    MEIKO: "Have a good evening then, Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Bye."
    Which leaves me to wander around the half-empty classroom and wonder how I managed to screw things up with at least two (and possibly up to four) different people today.
    Probably best to head home, or at least downstairs to the old wing.
    On the way out the door though, I manage to bump into someone.
    HAGAMI: "...!"
    TAKERU: "Ah, hey. Didn't see you."
    HAGAMI: "No, that's... I... that's..."
    TAKERU: "That's...?"
    HAGAMI: "Here."
    TAKERU: "Isn't that your lab notebook?"
    HAGAMI: "You need it for your report."
    TAKERU: "My what?"
    HAGAMI: "The report. You..."
    HAGAMI: "We each need a copy. I was the only one taking notes."
    HAGAMI: "So... here are my notes."
    TAKERU: "Oh. Thanks!"
    HAGAMI: "Yeah..."
    She leaves and I'm left staring down at her notebook.
    TAKERU: "Hagami?"
    She's already wandered off down the hall.
    I'll wander off as well. No point sticking around here all afternoon. The jostle of students all on their way back to the dorms, or to catch the bus, or to catch their friends at the gate...
    I'm heading the opposite direction, into the basement, and the old wing. Eventually the crowd thins out until there are only a dozen, five, then one person in front of me.
    ...That's one person I recognize, though. I've just followed Hagami this whole time. She's headed down here as well?
    I pause outside the door to the tearoom as I watch Hagami ahead of me take one step, then another, silently down the hall.
    What's she doing down here anyway? Heading back to the old library?
    HIKARI: "Hmm, quite the mystery, isn't it?"
    TAKERU: "Ah! Hikari! Stop creeping up behind me like that."
    HIKARI: "I could've crept up from any direction if you're going to doze off like that in the middle of the hall."
    HIKARI: "You're watching her?"
    TAKERU: "What? No, I was just..."
    TAKERU: "She gave me her notes and it's just weird to see Hagami down here this time of day, so..."
    HIKARI: "Mhm."
    TAKERU: "You're smirking. Stop acting like I've committed some crime."
    HIKARI: "That's fine. What were saying about notes?"
    TAKERU: "Nothing. We wound up lab partners, so Hagami loaned me her notes, and we left class at the same time, but it's odd that she'd..."
    TAKERU: "I get the feeling I'm just digging myself a deeper grave, here."
    HIKARI: "What makes you say that?"
    TAKERU: "Stop trying to analyze me, it's annoying. Let's just play chess or something."
    HIKARI: "I never thought the day would come where you'd be asking me to play."
    TAKERU: "Hey, I'm just trying to get you off my case about... whatever this is about."
    TAKERU: "You know, Hikari, I'd almost mistake you for someone high class, if you didn't keep creeping around down here and hanging out in the dark and implying weird things about people."
    HIKARI: "Mm, interesting. How about some tea as well for our game as well?"
    TAKERU: "You weren't even listening, were you?"
    HIKARI: "Listening about what?"
    TAKERU: "I'll make tea. Fine."
    
    Per usual, Hikari doesn't touch my tea, instead preferring to warm her hands over the cup as she calls out her moves to obliterate me in chess.
    HIKARI: "Knight. F6."
    TAKERU: "Right... Hang on..."
    HIKARI: "You've learned enough by now to force me to think once or twice. It shouldn't take you this long to work out which square on the board I'm referring to."
    TAKERU: "Cut me at least a little slack... I've got a lot on my mind."
    HIKARI: "Like what?"
    TAKERU: "It's just a saying."
    HIKARI: "No, really. I want to know."
    TAKERU: "You're just looking for another reason to make fun of me."
    HIKARI: "I'm not looking to mock you. If I wanted to do that I would've questioned why you just walked your rook into the most obvious fork since the - "
    TAKERU: "I'm taking that move back."
    HIKARI: "Fine."
    TAKERU: "'Fine?' Really?"
    HIKARI: "Fine."
    She must be in a better mood than I thought.
    TAKERU: "Never thought I'd see the day..."
    HIKARI: "You obviously have something on your mind, so I thought I'd take it easy on you."
    TAKERU: "I don't know. Maybe."
    TAKERU: "Don't feel like you have to pity me or anything."
    HIKARI: "You should tell me what's up. Whatever is happening at Mirako, you should let me know. Did you not hear that?"
    TAKERU: "I don't exactly lead the most interesting life around here."
    HIKARI: "That's what makes it interesting to me."
    HIKARI: "It... Sometimes it's hard for me to really understand what's going on with all of you in Mirako second year. Most of the time I want to give up trying to work it all out."
    HIKARI: "But sometimes I can relate to you, as a new student, and it makes me still interested in all the small gossip and drama you all go through. As a high school girl, it's healthy for that to be the sort of thing I'm into, isn't it?"
    TAKERU: "Hell if I know..."
    HIKARI: "Then I'm deciding that it's healthy. Queen, A2."
    TAKERU: "Hang on, wait, if you move your queen then that means that I..."
    TAKERU: "I'm taking that move back as well."
    HIKARI: "Too late. If you want to stay out of checkmate, then you're explaining to me what's going on between you and Hagami."
