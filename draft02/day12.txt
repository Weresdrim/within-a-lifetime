label day12:

    I wake up earlier than I need to, even without Kenta glowering over me. In fact I don't know where he is.
    My first priority, before I find Kenta, is to check the ruin. I can barely see it from the dorm window, but it's still there, in one piece. Burned, but not on fire.
    TAKERU: "Why do I care about that place so much anyway?"
    There's no living creature in sight, either. No pair of eyes next to mine.
    The only eyes belong to the pickled frog on the nightstand.
    TAKERU: "Whatever. Just have to ignore all this."
    I mostly just wish I'd quit having these ultra realistic dreams. For a medication called an "antipsychotic" you'd think I'd be seeing less in my sleep, not more.
    TAKERU: "I mean... What are the alternatives, anyway? Try to get off the meds?"
    TAKERU: "It can't be healthy to be on these things forever, can it?"
    TAKERU: "Also why am I having this conversation with a frog in a jar..."
    TAKERU: "Better than having it with Kenta I guess. At least he's given up waking me up."

    KENTA: "You're up earlier than usual."
    TAKERU: "Isn't this the time I'm always up? I mean, thanks to you interfering every time I'd like to sleep in."
    KENTA: "You're five minutes ahead of schedule. Any later and I'd have come upstairs to wake you."
    TAKERU: "You can be awfully cruel when you want to be."
    KENTA: "Would you rather be late? Normal people would thank me."
    TAKERU: "There's a strange lack of normal people around here. What're you ordering anyway?"
    There's an auction site up on Kenta's screen, with under thirty seconds to go. Top bidder is currently e_kenta_467.
    KENTA: "Please do
