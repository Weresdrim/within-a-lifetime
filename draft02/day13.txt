label day13:

    Sunday classes slide by.
    I could be sleepwalking. There's certainly nothing interesting in Kunida's class to hold my attention.
    Really the only things to note are that Meiko doesn't seem to anywhere to be found (weren't we getting lunch today?) and that Natsumi seems to actually be taking notes (possibly a sign of the apocalypse).
    Uusually she's just as rigorous as me about paying attention, but today she's constantly scribbling in a large, bound notebook. This continues all day through shortly after noon, when classes let out.
    TAKERU: "You're pretty enthusiastic about math today."
    NATSUMI: "Enthusiastic about... Math?"
    TAKERU: "The notebook."
    NATSUMI: "Oh this. Heheh."
    TAKERU: "That's about the most evil laugh I've ever heard."
    NATSUMI: "This is the first research report from Kenta. He had this thing ready this morning? Can you believe it?"
    TAKERU: "So... you've just been scheming, not actually taking notes."
    NATSUMI: "Hell no. You should know better than that. If I look like I'm having a good time with trigonometry then I've been replaced with an imposter Natsumi from another timeline."
    TAKERU: "I wonder..."
    TAKERU: "Where's Meiko, anyway?"
    NATSUMI: "Why are you always asking about her?"
    TAKERU: "We were supposed to meet up is all."
    NATSUMI: "Oh. Hm..."
    She glances around the room.
    Everyone is slowly filtering out in the lazy summer afternoon. But there's still no sign of our class rep.
    NATSUMI: "She was here this morning to give her pep talk but I guess she gave us the slip."
    NATSUMI: "Probably had some appointment or errand to run or award to receive or something. You know how it is with her."
    TAKERU: "I guess..."
    Not keeping an appointment though?
    KENTA: "Good afternoon."
    TAKERU: "Hey Kenta. Good afternoon."
    But Natsumi practically elbows me out of the way.
    NATSUMI: "Hey! Kenta, who's Matsuyama High going to be starting? Their entire rotation is blank here."
    KENTA: "Well I don't know."
    NATSUMI: "Aren't you friends with their stats guy?"
    KENTA: "No. I am explicitly not friends with him. Last year I traded him my copy of the 1979 stats book and the editions he sent in return were clearly damaged."
    NATSUMI: "Well I need you to be friends with him!"
    KENTA: "That's not in our terms."
    NATSUMI: "Hey Takeru, can I still get you to call in that favor on Kenta?"
    TAKERU: "Nope. Leave me out of this."
    NATSUMI: "I'll let you copy all the math notes you want."
    TAKERU: "Nice try but you already admitted you weren't actually taking notes today."
    NATSUMI: "Oh. Right. Damn."
    KENTA: "Fine. I'll message this Matsuyama contact of mine. But you'll show up tomorrow. On time."
    NATSUMI: "Great. Amazing! Of course I'll be there. Takeru, you're going to be there too, yeah?"
    TAKERU: "Where?"
    KENTA: "The egg - "
    TAKERU: "Nope sorry I'm booked all day."
    NATSUMI: "Come onn, Takeru. You're no fun."
    TAKERU: "See you guys later."
    I wander off but I'm not particularly sure where I'm headed.
    My hope was to wait around homeroom to see if Meiko showed up, but I guess she must've forgotten we had anything planned.
    Where would she be if she were here but not in class? The council room? The teachers' office? Not really places I'd want to hang around, even if they're better than standing between Kenta and Natsumi.
    Maybe I'll just head to where we met up last week... Time to see if I remember the way to the roof.
    
    After only a few wrong turns, I find the right staircase and the Mirako school rooftop.
    The wind is a nice break from the humidity, and the view of the valley is as commanding as ever. I'm surprised more students don't come up here, but then again, there's nowhere to sit up here, and
    it feels as unfinished as the rest of the school.
    A few leaves flap in the breeze, caught in railing. Off behind the school, from the field, there's the telltale sound of an baseball bat, a solid hit. I grab my left arm in reflex but I don't quite remember why.
    No sign of Meiko.
    There's that thwank again. Aluminum on leather. Natsumi holding practice?
    How long was I planning on staying up here anyway?
    Another hit from out at the fields.
    If I stay up here any longer I'll have wasted my whole free half day. Guess Meiko stood me up after all.
    ...When I stand up, I feel it.
    Eyes.
    ...not the eyes from that dream that were watching me from the bridge but all the same eyes that raise the hair on my nape that make me believe that directly behind me they're back Hifumi and the rest or who was it that -
    TAKERU: "Who..."
    TAKERU: "Who's there?"
    But whoever was hiding in the staircase has already stepped out.
    HAGAMI: "...Hi."
    TAKERU: "Who are - "
    TAKERU: "What are you doing behind the..."
    TAKERU: "Oh."
    TAKERU: "Hey Hagami. I guess I wasn't expecting company."
    HAGAMI: "No, it's... It's fine."
    I make an internal note to check just how 'internal' the words are that run through my head because if I just said any of that out loud I've just severely embarased myself.
    Not that Hagami would notice. She's sort of shrinking back down into the stairwell back to the school.
    TAKERU: "What're you doing up here anyway?"
    HAGAMI: "Me?"
    TAKERU: "There's no one else here, is there? Did you bring Mana along?"
    HAGAMI: "No. She's in the library."
    TAKERU: "Then you can come on up."
    It takes Hagami a few moments to climb the rest of the stairs as the wind picks up. She hesitates a moment, then joins me at the edge.
    HAGAMI: "That's..."
    TAKERU: "Yeah. Decent view, huh?"
    HAGAMI: "Mm."
    HAGAMI: "At my old school, well... We were in the city. So there was nothing like this."
    TAKERU: "Yeah, I've never really been anywhere this rural in a while. Tohoku was the suburbs."
    TAKERU: "Kind of seems like it'd be hard to go ghosthunting in a city though. How'd you and Mana manage?"
    HAGAMI: "Oh. I mean... After middle school. Last year."
    HAGAMI: "The Showa highschool. It was sort of attached to the Showa College of the Arts."
    TAKERU: "Sounds like a fancy music school. Transfering to this place must be a downgrade."
    I say it without thinking.
    HAGAMI: "It... Well.."
    HAGAMI: "Didn't work out."
    TAKERU: "'Didn't work out,' huh..."
    HAGAMI: "Sorry. I know it sounds dumb."
    TAKERU: "No, I get it. I really do."
    I'm actually pretty sure that's the exact phrase I used yesterday to get Meiko off my back about pitching.
    HAGAMI: "Do you... come up here often?"
    TAKERU: "No, I just had nothing better to do."
    HAGAMI: "Then um, well..."
    HAGAMI: "Mana and I usually meet in the library even on Saturday."
    HAGAMI: "So you can join us if you'd like. I mean, it's not - "
    HAGAMI: "If you don't - "
    TAKERU: "Oh well I was sort of waiting for somebody but I guess she's not going to show up, so, might as well."
    Killing time in the old library sounds a lot better than heading back to the empty dorms.
    TAKERU: "Right let's go. I must've misunderstood her..."
    I turn back around to Hagami, who is looking at nothing in particular on the horizon.
    HAGAMI: "Yeah..."
    
    There's no way I'd be able how to get from the rooftop stairs to the old library on my own. Luckily Hagami seems to be getting the hang of Mirako's haphazard layout better than me.
    We pass through a hall, down half a set of steps tucked into a corner, and come out into a disused corridor lit only by daylight from the broad windows. Familiar. The library should be directly ahead.
    HAGAMI: "Who.. were you waiting for?"
    TAKERU: "Just Meiko. We were going to try to grab lunch but, uh..."
    TAKERU: "I guess she's on a train back for her cram school by now."
    TAKERU: "Yeah, I must've misunderstood her..."
    HAGAMI: "..."
    TAKERU: "Oh, right, I forgot you didn't like her."
    I push open the door to the library to a terrifying sight:. The lone table is now piled to double its standard height in clutter. Papers, ornaments, scraps of cloth, notebooks, metal knicknacks, and other odds and ends now almost completely bury the radio.
    MANA: "Hi, Takeru!"
    TAKERU: "Uhh.. Hi."
    MANA: "You look like you've seen a ghost. Save that for tomorrow!"
    TAKERU: "What is all that junk?"
    MANA: "Hagami and I were just starting to get the equipment together for the ghosthunt when Hagami up and disappeared on me!"
    HAGAMI: "I... I did tell you I was going to find Takeru."
    MANA: "You said you'd see if he was still around! You were gone like an hour."
    HAGAMI: "Oh. Um..."
    MANA: "So I took the extra time and got everything we could possibly need. You're the expedition leader, Hagami, so you'll be choosing what we actually need."
    MANA: "And what're you staring at, Takeru? I didn't go overboard, did I?"
    TAKERU: "Is that Hikari's chess set?"
    MANA: "Whose?"
    TAKERU: "Hikari. You know, the girl we bumped into last ghost hunt."
    MANA: "Oh, yes, the ghost! Well that's why I grabbed it. It's probably haunted."
    MANA: "Master Hagami, shall we require a haunted chess set for tomorrow's ceremonies?"
    HAGAMI: "Um..."
    She's wincing but eventually speaks up.
    HAGAMI: "You can probably just return that."
    TAKERU: "I can run it back down to the basement."
    HAGAMI: "Or we could give it back during class on Monday."
    HAGAMI: "Is that... She is in our class, isn't she?"
    I must be looking at her funny because Hagami looks confused.
    TAKERU: "No, that's fine, she probably won't miss it before then..."
    Don't ask me why Hagami just casually mentioning Hikari feels so off. I guess I'd gotten used to people like Mana just never acknowledging that she existed.
    Wait, although... Why would Mana care about some idiotic girls' drama going on in a class above hers?
    HAGAMI: "Takeru?"
    TAKERU: "Huh?"
    MANA: "You zone out all the time! Did you know that?"
    TAKERU: "I didn't really think anyone paid enough attention to me to notice."
    MANA: "Well you were one hundred percent zoned out. Hagami was saying something important."
    HAGAMI: "Not that important..."
    MANA: "But if we don't go ghosthunting at Mirako, where will we go?"
    HAGAMI: "I know Mirako has the whole basement system, and the half built before the war, but..."
    HAGAMI: "We were here just last week so..."
    HAGAMI: "Hm... I thought maybe..."
    HAGAMI: "Do you know that old building on the river? The burned building?"
    MANA: "The um, old boathouse?"
    HAGAMI: "You can sort of see it from the bridge. It looks like maybe it burned at one point."
    MANA: "Yeah, it burned, but um..."
    MANA: "Wow... Are you sure? There are rumors that that place..."
    TAKERU: "And you said I was the one that looked like I'd seen a ghost..."
    There's practically no color left in Mana's face.
    MANA: "Well it's supposed to be haunted!"
    HAGAMI: "That's... the point?"
    TAKERU: "As long as the building's not going to fall into the water soon as anyone steps in there, that sounds fine to me."
    If we're not ghosthunting at Mirako, then that's one less chance we'll run into Hikari or Mr. Kunida or someone here late at night while I'm dressed like an off-brand pope.
    And My guess is we'd end up just poking around the outside of the ruin anyway.
    Although... While we're talking about this... I know Hagami will probably think less of me but I have to ask.
    TAKERU: "So can I get a straight answer about what actually happened over there?"
    MANA: "Um, I guess it burned down around this time last year."
    TAKERU: "Really? Only last year?"
    MANA: "At the festival."
    TAKERU: "Wait, during the Mirako school open house thing?"
    MANA: "Yeah. That's the only school festival we've got. It was a whole thing last year."
    MANA: "I didn't go to school here, I just heard about it from everyone else. Something with the fireworks and then the old boathouse caught fire."
    TAKERU: "Is that what that is? A boathouse?"
    MANA: "Yeah. My uncle said Mirako owns it, but it's not like we've had a rowing team for years and years. Back when the school was founded, that building was part of the original donation from the family that owned all this land."
    TAKERU: "Your uncle... So Mr. Kunida knows about it."
    MEIKO: "Yeah but he doesn't like talking about it, the whole fireworks thing."
    TAKERU: "Meiko was saying they canceled the fireworks this year anyway."
    MANA: "Really? That sucks... But I guess it makes sense."
    TAKERU: "Yeah, I guess, if there was an accident."
    TAKERU: "Then again..."
    There's something caught in my brain.
    With Kunida, and Meiko again. Canceling the fireworks.
    Last week... it's fuzzy, but wasn't it Mr. Kunida asking Meiko if she was sure about calling off the show? Why would she be involved? Wouldn't the teachers just cancel things and be done with it?
    Didn't he ask Meiko if she, Meiko, was sure about that decision? Why would she have control over it?
    MANA: "No fireworks... No Seiji first edition..."
    MANA: "We're going to need to have a great ghosthunt, or this school festival's going to be a huge letdown."
    MANA: "Let's find the best ghost we can tomorrow! And get the Mirako Ghosthunter Union off on the right foot!"
    HAGAMI: "Definitely."
    TAKERU: "Hang on, the what union?"
    MANA: "Master Hagami, let's start by going through the equipment."
    MANA: "The haunted chessboard is out. Semi-haunted rabbit censer?"
    HAGAMI: "Out."
    MANA: "But it's so cute though... Alright. Unlikely-to-be-haunted first edition of Solomon's - "
    HAGAMI: "Out."
    MANA: "Unlikely-to-haunted Mirako uniform from ten years ago?"
    HAGAMI: "Out."
    HAGAMI: "Maybe... Do we maybe have a flashlight?"
    TAKERU: "An unhaunted flashlight, please."
    MANA: "Um, no flashlights, of any hauntedness status."
    HAGAMI: "Or... gloves? Boots? It'll probably be muddy on the river."
    MANA: "Um, uh, none of those..."
    TAKERU: "We might be back to square one on the whole gear thing here."
    HAGAMI: "Then... you're coming?"
    MANA: "Coming to the first ghost hunt organized by Master Hagami? For sure!"
    MANA: "You could've chosen someplace less haunted to start with but I wouldn't miss it for the world!"
    
    We end up calling it a day about the same time classes would let out anyway.
    I walk back the familiar hall to the entrance as Mana chatters to Hagami next to me.
    MANA: "...and I'll ask Uncle about the camera."
    HAGAMI: "Camera?"
    MANA: "Yeah! We need some pictures of us out there if we're going to be advertising at the festival."
    TAKERU: "Maybe keep me out of those pictures."
    MANA: "That's no fun. But how about..."
    HAGAMI: "You could pretend to be a ghost! And then we could stage some action shots, like Hagami, um, throwing garlic at you, or - "
    TAKERU: "One: I'm pretty sure garlic is for vampires, and, two: vetoed. I'm not pretending to be a ghost or a vampire."
    HAGAMI: "Then, well... I can bring the garlic anyway. In case you choose your mind."
    TAKERU: "If you start pelting me with vegetables while we're in the middle of an abandoned building, I'm leaving on the spot. Just jumping out the window and into the river."
    We pass our now-empty homeroom. It's lucky that no one's around to hear this non-conversation, but at least
