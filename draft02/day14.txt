label day14:

    Sunday.
    My one and only chance to sleep in...
    At least in theory.
    There's someone bellowing right outside the door. Or throwing bricks. Or something.
    TAKERU: "Please just shut up..."
    Voices, ones I recognize.
    The usual suspects...
    Every time I get a half-decent night's sleep, why does it always have to be interrupted by Natsumi - 
    Hang on, what is Natsumi doing here?
    TAKERU: "What the - "
    NATSUMI: "Oh, look who's up. Great! Here, Takeru hold this."
    TAKERU: "Ow, that's heavy. I'm still in bed, don't just drop stuff on me."
    TAKERU: "What are you even doing in here?"
    KENTA: "Helping me. I did tell you about this, you remember."
    TAKERU: "No, I don't. Is she even allowed to be in here?"
    NATSUMI: "Well I mean no one stopped me."
    NATSUMI: "Here, can you hold this too?"
    TAKERU: "No, I'm not even - oof!"
    NATSUMI: "Thanks! We're still trying to even get the fridge installed in here so it's gonna be a long morning I think. It'll go faster with three people."
    NATSUMI: "Actually, hang on."
    There's a blessed moment of silence.
    They... they finished?
    I push have a dozen boxes off my bed and another off my legs and prepare to try to get back to -
    STUDENT1: "Hey Natsumi, you don't mean in here, do you?"
    STUDENT2: "Is this even the right room?"
    NATSUMI: "Yep. Kenta, that corner?"
    KENTA: "Yes, but please be careful. You're going too quickly. You'll break it."
    NATSUMI: "Relax, relax."
    STUDENT1: "Slow down!"
    STUDENT2: "Well don't push me into the - "
    By that crunching sound, I think it's safe to say there's now a dent in dresser. Or else the dorm room wall.
    TAKERU: "I give up..."
    
    The common room is at least a bit quieter. Not that that says much, after having my room invaded by Meiko and her gang of a baseball team.
    Unfortunately I don't have anything else to do than attempt my schoolwork, and much earlier in the day than I'd like to be doing anything like this.
    In particular, the problem is that I'm going to doze off as soon as I even start to think about this mess of notes and textbooks I've scattered all over the table.
    I guess there's no helping it. I'll just try to catch up on sleep a bit. At least I've still got that Modern Science-Key book from Hagami... about the right size for a pillow.
    A little hard, but...
    I didn't realie I was this tired.
    ...
    ...
    The sun is shining through the window and directly onto my face.
    Guess I can't nap after all. Dammit.
    But if the sun is that high... It must be close to noon.
    TAKERU: "How long was I out...?"
    HAGAMI: "Um, I guess maybe - "
    TAKERU: "Ah!"
    I sit up so fast is sends a cloud of papers everywhere.
    HAGAMI: "Sorry! I thought you were talking to me."
    TAKERU: "I didn't even see you. How long have you been there?"
    HAGAMI: "I've been here since this morning..."
    TAKERU: "Seriously?"
    Maybe I was so bleary-eyed I missed her, camouflaged in her corner behind a hardcover.
    HAGAMI: "The book wasn't... You didn't find it interesting?"
    TAKERU: "The what?"
    HAGAMI: "'A Master-Key to the Mysteries of Ancient - '"
    TAKERU: "Oh."
    The pillow.
    TAKERU: "No, sorry. I could only make it through a few pages."
    HAGAMI: "It's fine."
    HAGAMI: "I probably should've expected that..."
    MEIKO: "Ah hey Takeru, what's up?"
    TAKERU: "Oh no..."
    MEIKO: "Hm, something on your mind?"
    TAKERU: "Not really, just you storming my room on a weekend morning and now - "
    MEIKO: "Sorry, you'll have to tell me some other time, I'm already late to practice and I'm supposed to be the one running things."
    MEIKO: "Kenta!"
    KENTA: "Yes?"
    MEIKO: "What's the word on Matsuyama High?"
    KENTA: "Checking."
    MEIKO: "To the PC!"
    MEIKO: "Hiro! Kouichi! Get that thing out of here! Hurry up!"
    TAKERU: "What the - "
    STUDENT1: "We're going..."
    STUDENT2: "This thing's too heavy. Can't we just get to practice already?"
    TAKERU: "Kenta, is that our dresser?"
    KENTA: "Technically it was our display case. It's being upgraded."
    TAKERU: "Where is it going? What are you two doing to - "
    KENTA: "I'd love to talk later but I'm a bit of a hurry. It's all very simple anyway."
    KENTA: "There's been no update from my contact at Matsuyama."
    MEIKO: "You did butter him up, didn't you? Like I said?"
    KENTA: "I'm not going to flatter him. He's an ass."
    MEIKO: "Noo! Next time I'm writing these people, even if I have to pretend to be you."
    MEIKO: "Never mind, never mind. Running late!"
    And just like that, the two of them, plus the ballplayers, plus my former dresser are all out the door.
    TAKERU: "There just can't be a quiet day around here..."
    HAGAMI: "He... That's your roommate?"
    TAKERU: "Yeah. Don't remind me."
    TAKERU: "He's helpful sometimes but most mornings I'd trade him for just about anyone."
    HAGAMI: "I just wish I lived alone..."
    TAKERU: "Yeah, some peace and quiet might be nice."
    TAKERU: "But if we're stuck down here, do you want to try and make some headway on that lab report? I've got literally nothing to do until the, er - "
    Good, the rest of the room is deserted.
    TAKERU: "Nothing to do until the ghosthunt."
    HAGAMI: "...Me neither. Doing the report sounds fun."
    HAGAMI: "Um, not 'fun,' but uh..."
    TAKERU: "Right. Got to get it out of the way... So might as well get started."
    
    We make a decent amount of progress. Or I should say, Hagami makes most of the progress. I'm useless as usual.
    At least working with her is quiet in pleasant, in constrast to this a morning of Meiko and Kenta.
    ...Whatever they did to my room, I don't want to know. I'll deal with that tonight.
    Hagami eventually heads upstairs to prepare, and I'm left to clean the mess of papers that have accumulated over the hours I've been down here.
    TAKERU: "Probably shouldn't have slept on that one..."
    Half the pages of my math textbook are now folded.
    TAKERU: "Oh well."
    I head upstairs.
    On the third floor, I stop. The door to my room is already open. Is that what they were up to? Tearing the door off its hinges? While it'd be hard to imagine anything less convenient, whatever it was happening up here... I'm about to witness it.
    I take a deep breath, three steps and open my eyes.
    KENTA: "Why do you have your eyes closed?"
    TAKERU: "Kenta?"
    KENTA: "Yes, good afternoon. Why do you have your eyes closed?"
    TAKERU: "Well they're open now."
    KENTA: "But you still had them closed a second ago. Why did you do that?"
    TAKERU: "To prepare for the schock of whatever you did to our room, I guess."
    TAKERU: "I guess there wasn't anything really shocking in here but you, anyway."
    KENTA: "I personally don't think I'm very shocking so I don't get - "
    TAKERU: "Wait hang on what the hell is THAT thing?"
    There's a man-tall red boxy thing in the near corner where the dresser used to be.
    KENTA: "The new fridge."
    TAKERU: "New? It... It's round and red and plastic. Is that pre-war? No way that was made less than fifty years ago."
    KENTA: "Well I did have to purchase it used. It turns out the market for preserved amphibians deflated slightly since I invested - "
    TAKERU: "And why do we have a fridge now?"
    KENTA: "You're the one that suggested it."
    TAKERU: "Er, you sure about that?"
    TAKERU: "I meant... Not that I mind a place to store drinks and stuff up here. That's kind of neat."
    KENTA: "You said I shouldn't store the eggs down in the kitchen because it was unsanitary."
    TAKERU: "Of course not, putting bird's eggs in the public..."
    TAKERU: "...the public fridge... So now we have a private fridge."
    KENTA: "Exactly. I'm glad you learn quick."
    TAKERU: "Well... It could be worse I guess."
    I sit down on the bed while continue returns to his work at the desk.
    Where on earth did he find a used fridge on two day's notice? How did he recruit an army to move it in on two day's notice?
    I'm starting to think Kenta's a lot craftier than I had him for.
    ...I should probably get moving though.
    TAKERU: "Hey, do you happen to have a flashlight? I'm also looking for work gloves."
    KENTA: "A flashlight? What for?"
    TAKERU: "Oh, nothing. I'm heading out tonight."
    KENTA: "What, to vandalize something? What do you need a flashlight for? Shizukawa might not be a big town but we at least have streetlights."
    TAKERU: "Why would I need a flashlight to - "
    TAKERU: "Never mind. I might go on a, er, field expedition tonight. So I might as well get ready now."
    KENTA: "I've moved all the household items to the closet from the old display cabinet. Flashlights are in the emergency supply, third shelf, arranged by battery power left to right. Gloves are probably..."
    KENTA: "Are you wearing a specific jacket? You'll probably want gloves to match that."
    TAKERU: "I'm not trying to make a fashion statement here."
    KENTA: "Third drawer down, in the pockets of the coats on the right half."
    TAKERU: "How do you keep this stuff straight?"
    KENTA: "You're a very hard to understand person. I don't know why you keep getting this mixed up."
    I'm about to complain, but then again, this is his stuff he's lending out.
    TAKERU: "You're the best, Kenta."
    KENTA: "If you end up vandalizing something I'm still telling the police."
    TAKERU: "I'm not vandalizing anything!"
    
    For simplicity's sake, we've agreed to meet at the school.
    It's a little earlier than we scheduled the last ghosthunt, if only because I don't feel like trying to walk through the woods alongside the Shizukawa just by flashlight. (Mana would probably fall in)
    The picnic tables out front are empty, but one or two students pass through the main doors. Probably they're here for weekend club meetings, or maybe -
    There's that thwank again, echoing from the field back behind the school somewhere.
    ...here for weekend meetings or practices.
    Can't the baseball season just be over already? Why do I keep wincing at that noise? Didn't I erase all that? Nobody attacked me I imagined it then why do I keep -
    Never mind.
    I'm about to take a seat when Hagami emerges from the school, waving.
    TAKERU: "Hi. You beat me here."
    HAGAMI: "Sorry, I was waiting inside. It's hot out and this is... heavy."
    TAKERU: "What all did you pack?"
    She drops an overstuffed backpack onto the table. I notice a first aid kit stuffed into a pocked on one side, and on top, a flashlight bigger than Kenta's max watt model.
    TAKERU: "I really didn't need to bring anything, did I?"
    HAGAMI: "If I'm the one supposed to be organizing, then... I don't want us to miss anything."
    HAGAMI: "If someone gets hurt, or we need to... break in."
    TAKERU: "Right. Is that a crowbar?"
    I don't think I was really thinking about it but this could be kind of dangerous, couldn't it? Wouldn't it make sense for the ruin to be condemned or something?
    And hang on, "break in?" Is Hagami going to prove Kenta right?
    After the first "ghost hunt" I figured we'd be just be hanging around outside it or something else lame but the way Hagami's equipped, it seems like - 
    Thwanck. Again. What is going on out there, batting practice? Annoying. Very annoying.
    HAGAMI: "Are you...?"
    TAKERU: "I'm fine."
    HAGAMI: "..."
    HAGAMI: "Do you miss it?"
    TAKERU: "What?"
    HAGAMI: "I mean... Do you miss baseball?"
    TAKERU: "Yeah all the.. I mean, no, I could never... Who told you anything about that?"
    HAGAMI: "Sorry. I wasn't thinking before asking something like... that."
    I mean, what can I say? I don't even know how I feel myself. On the one hand, after talking to Hikari yesterday, there's no denying I'd do some pretty out-there things to do back to my old life.
    That just hinges on my old life being anything like I remember it. Surely I can... change that, can't I?
    Should I?
    If so, how?
    It should be doable. Doesn't the letter keep changing on me? And Jun himself? Or Meiko? Meiko's ribbon?  Or -
    Hagami's eyeing me a little strangely.
    MANA: "Hey! Hey guys! Sorry I'm late!"
    HAGAMI: "Hi Mana."
    MANA: "Oof!"
    TAKERU: "Are you alright?"
    She drops a giant basket to the table, right next to Hagami's giant backpack.
    MANA: "Sorry, sorry, it took me longer to get here because I was carrying all this stuff."
    TAKERU: "You know you're going to have to carry all that down to the water, right?"
    MANA: "Umm..."
    TAKERU: "What even is all that?"
    MANA: "I made everyone lunch, for one thing! Or dinner I guess."
    TAKERU: "I thought this was a ghost hunt, not a field trip."
    HAGAMI: "Field expedition."
    TAKERU: "Who are we even kidding at this point..."
    MANA: "It'll be fun, so who cares what it's called?"
    HAGAMI: "We should... probably get moving. So we can walk while it's still light out."
    MANA: "Please can I just catch my breath? All of this is really heavy!"
    TAKERU: "Don't you take a bus up here?"
    MANA: "Yeah but I still had to walk from the bus stop to - "
    TAKERU: "Never mind. Hold this flashlight and I'm carrying the basket."
    MANA: "Thanks Takeru!"
    TAKERU: "I'd feel like an idiot just carrying that when you both came prepared for... I don't know, a school picnic and the apocalypse, respectively."
    MANA: "You'll thank me when you're hungry!"
    HAGAMI: "And you'll thank me when the world ends."
    Once I get the hang of this revisionist history thing I'm going to choose to remember a timeline where I'm not the butt of every joke.
    
    There's a dirt trail leading off the road just before the Shizukawa bridge. Hagami and I pass it every day on the way to Mirako, so there's no way we'd miss it.
    But I'd expected the path to be just that - a path. It turns out, once we leave the road and descend down to water level, the woods that surround the river take over. The path is more like a trail.
    I'd guessed the old boathouse wasn't more than a mile from the bridge, but that estimate might've been off. At any rate, the route we're taking isn't straight and more than once there's a tight turn around some overhang into the river.
    TAKERU: "Ha... Ha..."
    TAKERU: "What kind of boathouse do you have to hike to? Why didn't they just build it on the road?"
    MANA: "No one had used it in forever, even before it burned down. They built the road after the boathouse was already up, I think."
    TAKERU: "Then why did this backwards school own it in the first place?"
    MANA: "Dunno. I'll ask my uncle sometime. But if you read the big plaque in the school lobby it says all about the family who donated the land and the original building and all."
    TAKERU: "Right... They're the ones to blame for building a school into a mountainside labyrinth..."
    There's another sharp curve and I almost slip. A few pebbles tumble down the slope.
    TAKERU: "Not that it looks like there's any better place to building anything in this backwoods."
    HAGAMI: "Are you alright?"
    TAKERU: "I'm fine, just out of shape."
    TAKERU: "And Mana, you chose about the least convenient container for all this. Why couldn't you have packed a backpack like Hagami..."
    MANA: "I thought boys were supposed to be grateful when you brought them food, and all you do is complain, complain, complain."
    TAKERU: "Well, you brought food, and what feels like half the old library reference collection. Seriously, what is in here?"
    MANA: "Why don't we just stop here and take a break? We can eat, and I can you guys what I found."
    TAKERU: "Sounds good."
    I drop the basket with a whump onto a tree stump.
    Tree stump? None of the rest of the woods around here is clear, but...
    HAGAMI: "Looks like it's a clearing."
    TAKERU: "Yeah."
    MANA: "And not a bad view!"
    From the water's edge, the bridge is barely visible. We really did walk a ways.
    And in the other direction...
    Only a blackened balcony is visible above the trees. But I can hear wood creaking the wind. We can't be too far off.
    MANA: "Here, Hagami, that's yours. And for you, Takeru."
    A sandwich. Not bad, but not much of a dinner... I was sort of expected a bit more considering the weight of the basket I lugged all the way out to this spot.
    MANA: "But this! This is the main attraction."
    Mana pulls out an entire bed's worth of sheets from the basket, followed by a worn cardboard box. She fiddles with packing tape at the edges, where the paper has almost dissolved into dust. Finally she raises up...
    MANA: "A camera!"
    TAKERU: "That's, er, quite the antique."
    I didn't see an older gadget today than Kenta's ancient fridge, but this camera is pre-war for sure. The whole thing is a beige box of right angles and faded metal etchings. And all the weight I've been carrying is from the film box and additional lenses that Mana continues to unwrap.
    HAGAMI: "You found it?"
    MANA: "My uncle had it in the back room. It wasn't even too hard to find. I'm glad you remember it though!"
    TAKERU: "I know for a fact Kenta owns a camera I could've borrowed, in case you're looking for something a little more modern."
    MANA: "But that's the point!"
    TAKERU: "...and a lot lighter. Who still uses manual film? Don't you have to get that stuff developed?"
    HAGAMI: "The film... it's..."
    HAGAMI: "Have you ever seen ghost photography?"
    TAKERU: "No."
    HAGAMI: "All the old occultist societies used to experiment with these techniques that need film, like..."
    HAGAMI: "If I took half a picture, and for half of the exposure, you were in the frame... And half the exposure you were out of frame..."
    TAKERU: "I have no idea how a camera that old actually works."
    HAGAMI: "You'd have a photograph where you were transparent. A ghost-Takeru."
    HAGAMI: "Mana and I used to try things like that, but... We never did get any real results."
    MANA: "Yeah, that's why I brought all the sheets, too! I bet we can stage some great shots!"
    TAKERU: "So this is more like a ghost glamour shoot than a ghost hunt?"
    MANA: "Well if we see any actual ghosts then we're still prepared! And if not, then this sheet will look stunning on you."
    TAKERU: "I'm not wearing anything!"
    MANA: "Calm down, calm down. You're gonna have to learn to use the camera then, though."
    TAKERU: "That's fine. It can't be that hard, can it?"
