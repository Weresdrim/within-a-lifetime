label day14:

    Sunday.
    My one and only chance to sleep in...
    At least in theory.
    There's someone bellowing right outside the door. Or throwing bricks. Or something.
    TAKERU: "Please just shut up..."
    Voices, ones I recognize.
    The usual suspects...
    Every time I get a half-decent night's sleep, why does it always have to be interrupted by Natsumi - 
    Hang on, what is Natsumi doing here?
    TAKERU: "What the - "
    NATSUMI: "Oh, look who's up. Great! Here, Takeru hold this."
    TAKERU: "Ow, that's heavy. I'm still in bed, don't just drop stuff on me."
    TAKERU: "What are you even doing in here?"
    KENTA: "Helping me. I did tell you about this, you remember."
    TAKERU: "No, I don't. Is she even allowed to be in here?"
    NATSUMI: "Well I mean no one stopped me."
    NATSUMI: "Here, can you hold this too?"
    TAKERU: "No, I'm not even - oof!"
    NATSUMI: "Thanks! We're still trying to even get the fridge installed in here so it's gonna be a long morning I think. It'll go faster with three people."
    NATSUMI: "Actually, hang on."
    There's a blessed moment of silence.
    They... they finished?
    I push have a dozen boxes off my bed and another off my legs and prepare to try to get back to -
    STUDENT1: "Hey Natsumi, you don't mean in here, do you?"
    STUDENT2: "Is this even the right room?"
    NATSUMI: "Yep. Kenta, that corner?"
    KENTA: "Yes, but please be careful. You're going too quickly. You'll break it."
    NATSUMI: "Relax, relax."
    STUDENT1: "Slow down!"
    STUDENT2: "Well don't push me into the - "
    By that crunching sound, I think it's safe to say there's now a dent in dresser. Or else the dorm room wall.
    TAKERU: "I give up..."
    
    The common room is at least a bit quieter. Not that that says much, after having my room invaded by Meiko and her gang of a baseball team.
    Unfortunately I don't have anything else to do than attempt my schoolwork, and much earlier in the day than I'd like to be doing anything like this.
    In particular, the problem is that I'm going to doze off as soon as I even start to think about this mess of notes and textbooks I've scattered all over the table.
    I guess there's no helping it. I'll just try to catch up on sleep a bit. At least I've still got that Modern Science-Key book from Hagami... about the right size for a pillow.
    A little hard, but...
    I didn't realie I was this tired.
    ...
    ...
    The sun is shining through the window and directly onto my face.
    Guess I can't nap after all. Dammit.
    But if the sun is that high... It must be close to noon.
    TAKERU: "How long was I out...?"
    HAGAMI: "Um, I guess maybe - "
    TAKERU: "Ah!"
    I sit up so fast is sends a cloud of papers everywhere.
    HAGAMI: "Sorry! I thought you were talking to me."
    TAKERU: "I didn't even see you. How long have you been there?"
    HAGAMI: "I've been here since this morning..."
    TAKERU: "Seriously?"
    Maybe I was so bleary-eyed I missed her, camouflaged in her corner behind a hardcover.
    HAGAMI: "The book wasn't... You didn't find it interesting?"
    TAKERU: "The what?"
    HAGAMI: "'A Master-Key to the Mysteries of Ancient - '"
    TAKERU: "Oh."
    The pillow.
    TAKERU: "No, sorry. I could only make it through a few pages."
    HAGAMI: "It's fine."
    HAGAMI: "I probably should've expected that..."
    MEIKO: "Ah hey Takeru, what's up?"
    TAKERU: "Oh no..."
    MEIKO: "Hm, something on your mind?"
    TAKERU: "Not really, just you storming my room on a weekend morning and now - "
    MEIKO: "Sorry, you'll have to tell me some other time, I'm already late to practice and I'm supposed to be the one running things."
    MEIKO: "Kenta!"
    KENTA: "Yes?"
    MEIKO: "What's the word on Matsuyama High?"
    KENTA: "Checking."
    MEIKO: "To the PC!"
    MEIKO: "Hiro! Kouichi! Get that thing out of here! Hurry up!"
    TAKERU: "What the - "
    STUDENT1: "We're going..."
    STUDENT2: "This thing's too heavy. Can't we just get to practice already?"
    TAKERU: "Kenta, is that our dresser?"
    KENTA: "Technically it was our display case. It's being upgraded."
    TAKERU: "Where is it going? What are you two doing to - "
    KENTA: "I'd love to talk later but I'm a bit of a hurry. It's all very simple anyway."
    KENTA: "There's been no update from my contact at Matsuyama."
    MEIKO: "You did butter him up, didn't you? Like I said?"
    KENTA: "I'm not going to flatter him. He's an ass."
    MEIKO: "Noo! Next time I'm writing these people, even if I have to pretend to be you."
    MEIKO: "Never mind, never mind. Running late!"
    And just like that, the two of them, plus the ballplayers, plus my former dresser are all out the door.
    TAKERU: "There just can't be a quiet day around here..."
    HAGAMI: "He... That's your roommate?"
    TAKERU: "Yeah. Don't remind me."
    TAKERU: "He's helpful sometimes but most mornings I'd trade him for just about anyone."
    HAGAMI: "I just wish I lived alone..."
    TAKERU: "Yeah, some peace and quiet might be nice."
    TAKERU: "But if we're stuck down here, do you want to try and make some headway on that lab report? I've got literally nothing to do until the, er - "
    Good, the rest of the room is deserted.
    TAKERU: "Nothing to do until the ghosthunt."
    HAGAMI: "...Me neither. Doing the report sounds fun."
    HAGAMI: "Um, not 'fun,' but uh..."
    TAKERU: "Right. Got to get it out of the way... So might as well get started."
