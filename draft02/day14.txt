label day14:

    Sunday.
    My one and only chance to sleep in...
    At least in theory.
    There's someone bellowing right outside the door. Or throwing bricks. Or something.
    TAKERU: "Please just shut up..."
    Voices, ones I recognize.
    The usual suspects...
    Every time I get a half-decent night's sleep, why does it always have to be interrupted by Natsumi - 
    Hang on, what is Natsumi doing here?
    TAKERU: "What the - "
    NATSUMI: "Oh, look who's up. Great! Here, Takeru hold this."
    TAKERU: "Ow, that's heavy. I'm still in bed, don't just drop stuff on me."
    TAKERU: "What are you even doing in here?"
    KENTA: "Helping me. I did tell you about this, you remember."
    TAKERU: "No, I don't. Is she even allowed to be in here?"
    NATSUMI: "Well I mean no one stopped me."
    NATSUMI: "Here, can you hold this too?"
    TAKERU: "No, I'm not even - oof!"
    NATSUMI: "Thanks! We're still trying to even get the fridge installed in here so it's gonna be a long morning I think. It'll go faster with three people."
