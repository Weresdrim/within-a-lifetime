label day15:

    I had hoped to never see this room again.
    Pale yellows, off whites, bright lights... Nothing personal in sight.
    The psychiatric clinic.
    I thought I'd left this place behind a month ago, but through some cruelty I'm back. Practically the same room, too. The other patients, the noise... I've gotten used to it now. Except this time I don't want to leave my room.
    Leave the clinic? I'm not sure. When I was here the first time I wanted out as soon as possible. Now, I don't even know. Maybe this is where I'm supposed to be. Locked up.
    Standing up from the bed, I look out the window over to the courtyard. Fenced, of course. People like me are a menace.
    It's been what, three days since I showed up here?
    They said they want me back at Mirako as soon as they've evaluated the meds. Tough to say how long that will be.
    Down in the courtyard, on the bench, there's a girl about my age, holding a book in one hand and a pad of paper in the other. Schoolwork?
    School? 
    I was already a month behind everyone. It's anybody's guess how much time this will cost. What's the point any more?
    And how much time did I lose?
    It was just a day or two that I don't remember. Well, I won't kid myself. Some part of me remembers showing up at Mirako the next day, armed with the knowledge that Hikari was never real, that the conspiracy was -
    No, that's the same part of me also remembers a certain baseball practice, a letter from a teammate, a night of fire on the Shizukawa that I shouldn't remember at all.
    I'll file those missing days under "thoughts I shouldn't revisit unless I want to be reminded that I've squandered all my chances and screwed up all I've been given." Just pretend those days are blank... it's hardly even pretending.
    The only thing I wish I could had back was that instant on Sunday where I thought I'd unraveled some giant, worldly puzzle. I was so sure of everything.
    It probably was a delusion. Then again, that's what I'm trying to figure out: what of the past month at Mirako wasn't a delusion?
    Useless.
    Pointless to reason about. I can't trust my memory.
    I sit back in bed again, only for a knock to sound from the door. Today's shrink, I suppose.
    TAKERU: "Yeah. Come in."
    KUNIDA: "Hi. Takeru?"
    Turning around... it's him again?
