label day15:

    I had hoped to never see this room again.
    Pale yellows, off whites, bright lights... Nothing personal in sight.
    The psychiatric clinic.
    I thought I'd left this place behind a month ago, but through some cruelty I'm back. Practically the same room, too. The other patients, the noise... I've gotten used to it now. Except this time I don't want to leave my room.
    Leave the clinic? I'm not sure. When I was here the first time I wanted out as soon as possible. Now, I don't even know. Maybe this is where I'm supposed to be. Locked up.
    Standing up from the bed, I look out the window over to the courtyard. Fenced, of course. People like me are a menace.
    It's been what, three days since I showed up here?
    They said they want me back at Mirako as soon as they've evaluated the meds. Tough to say how long that will be.
    Down in the courtyard, on the bench, there's a girl about my age, holding a book in one hand and a pad of paper in the other. Schoolwork?
    School? 
    I was already a month behind everyone. It's anybody's guess how much time this will cost. What's the point any more?
    And how much time did I lose?
    It was just a day or two that I don't remember. Well, I won't kid myself. Some part of me remembers showing up at Mirako the next day, armed with the knowledge that Hikari was never real, that the conspiracy was -
    No, that's the same part of me also remembers a certain baseball practice, a letter from a teammate, a night of fire on the Shizukawa that I shouldn't remember at all.
    I'll file those missing days under "thoughts I shouldn't revisit unless I want to be reminded that I've squandered all my chances and screwed up all I've been given." Just pretend those days are blank... it's hardly even pretending.
    The only thing I wish I could had back was that instant on Sunday where I thought I'd unraveled some giant, worldly puzzle. I was so sure of everything.
    It probably was a delusion. Then again, that's what I'm trying to figure out: what of the past month at Mirako wasn't a delusion?
    Useless.
    Pointless to reason about. I can't trust my memory.
    I sit back in bed again, only for a knock to sound from the door. Today's shrink, I suppose.
    TAKERU: "Yeah. Come in."
    KUNIDA: "Hello? Takeru?"
    Turning around... it's him again?
    TAKERU: "Oh. It's good to see you Mr. Kunida."
    KUNIDA: "You don't need to sound so formal about! Hi, Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Yeah, then... hi."
    KUNIDA: "I didn't think you'd be all that enthusiastic if it was just me showing up. And she wanted to come anyway, so..."
    MANA: "Takeru!"
    TAKERU: "Mana?"
    MANA: "Hi! I heard about what happened and um well..."
    MANA: "If you were in the hospital of course I'd come visit."
    TAKERU: "This isn't really a hospital. More a holding pen, or, observation booth, or..."
    MANA: "It doesn't matter. You're obviously not feeling well so I thought I'd cheer you up. Right?"
    TAKERU: "Er..."
    MANA: "I guess Hagami would do a better job but she um, well..."
    TAKERU: "It's fine."
    KUNIDA: "Did you bring his things?"
    MANA: "Yep. Here you go."
    TAKERU: "Oh, thanks, that's my backpack. Wish I'd grabbed that."
    MANA: "And a change of clothes."
    TAKERU: "Oh er, thanks. Where did...?"
    MANA: "I had to go find your roommate and he gave them to me. He said he wasn't sure if you wanted the solid color underwear or the - "
    TAKERU: "Dammit Kenta."
    MANA: " - and he wanted me to be very clear with you that you had to return it and - "
    How would I not return it? Aren't these my clothes in the first place?
    MANA: " - and he said it'd be rude if you didn't come back."
    Oh. I think I sort of get why Kunida is here now.
    TAKERU: "And this is... a chess set?"
    MANA: "It was on the shelf at the club library. I thought you might be bored and want it?"
    It's a plastic set, with a folding board. Not anywhere near as nice as Hagami's hand-carved -
    I mean, the hand-carved set from the old tea room.
    TAKERU: "Thanks. Not that there's anyone to play with."
    MANA: "Oh, um... I guess I didn't think of that."
    TAKERU: "Thanks though. Really."
    MANA: "Sorry! I tried, I really did!"
    MANA: "And Hagami said to say hi! So best wishes from both of us."
    I really kind of doubt she said anything of the sort.
    And it sounds heartless, but I just really want Mana out of the room. I hate people seeing me down like this. Especially someone as upbeat as her.
    TAKERU: "Yeah. Thanks."
    KUNIDA: "Mana, I'll probably want to speak to Takeru alone for a minute or two. Do you mind?"
    MANA: "Oh! Okay sorry I'll let you be. Come back soon though, Takeru, okay? Hope you're feeling better!"
    TAKERU: "I'll try. Thanks."
    It's like she thinks I'm sick with a physical illness or something. I wish I could just sleep for a week and shrug off schizophrenia forever.
    But no, instead I'm faced with Kunida, who has now shut the door.
    TAKERU: "So I guess I'm expelled."
    KUNIDA: "Expelled?"
    TAKERU: "I can't really blame you all, if you think I'm some threat to the other students."
    TAKERU: "If you know what's going to happen to me... Just tell me. You don't need to sugar-coat it."
    KUNIDA: "No one's expelling you. You're the type of student Mirako was made for."
    TAKERU: "I kind of find that..."
    TAKERU: "Are you sure?"
    KUNIDA: "Of course I'm sure. I'm a senior teacher at Mirako. I'm supposed to be your mentor, aren't I?"
    TAKERU: "Er..."
    KUNIDA: "Maybe I haven't been doing as good a job as I could be."
    KUNIDA: "Ha! Well I guess it makes sense you wouldn't trust me that much."
    No, I don't trust you. You couldn't fake a smile for a million bucks.
    KUNIDA: "It's a common syptom, you know?"
    TAKERU: "Symptom of what?"
    KUNIDA: "Ahh, well... Schizophrenia."
    KUNIDA: "You can start seeing motives in other people when there really isn't anything there at all."
    And what would you know about that?
    TAKERU: "Right..."
    KUNIDA: "Did you know I used to be in your shoes?"
    TAKERU: "No."
    You haven't been in my shoes, for one thing. Have you ever managed to burn not only the bridges behind you, but the ones in front as well?
    Because I've done a pretty good job of toasting all my previous ties to Tohoku plus torching any chances I had of fitting in at Mirako.
    KUNIDA: "Okay, maybe not me. But it's sort of the scene where me and my brother ended up."
    KUNIDA: "Mana never told you anything about my brother?"
    TAKERU: "Her father?"
    KUNIDA: "Ah, right, right, he'd be more like her father to her than my brother to me."
    I have no idea what you're talking about.
    KUNIDA: "Maybe I mean I know more what Mana's going through. Her dad, well... I have some not-so-great memories of visiting brother in the hospital."
    TAKERU: "Sorry, sir. I'm really not sure I get it. If you're just here to drop off my math homework..."
    He laughs that obviously forced laugh for a second then turns more serious than I can remember seeing my old cheery homeroom teacher.
    KUNIDA: "Schizophrenia is partly a genetic disease. It runs in families."
    KUNIDA: "My brother suffered through it. He... ended up, well, dying young."
    KUNIDA: "So I look after Mana."
    TAKERU: "...Sorry to hear it."
    KUNIDA: "It's alright. This was a long time ago, and I think it was a bit of wake-up call for me. I wouldn't be teaching at Mirako otherwise without my niece or brother. So that's some good out of everything. Right?"
    Please, just... Stop laughing. I can tell you're faking it.
    KUNIDA: "My point is that the Mirako is someplace where you can belong, if you want to. Of course I can't speak to exactly what you're going through these past couple days..."
    KUNIDA: "But I think, when you're ready to talk, you can feel free to come and find me."
    KUNIDA: "I hope you'll be back at Mirako before the end of the week. If your doctors think you need more time to get used to your new prescriptions though, don't feel guilty about staying here. We can wait."
    KUNIDA: "Take as much time as you need and when the docs clear you, we'll make the arrangements to get you back."
    KUNIDA: "You're not expelled or anything close to that. The Mirako school will always have a seat for you, and if you need someone to guide you through things, I might not be your first choice, but hey, I'm better than nothing, right?"
    KUNIDA: "Right?"
    I can only offer him a nod.
    Kunida stays for a few more minutes, just to go over schoolwork and sign a few forms. Guess they're serious about keeping me at Mirako.
    ...Wonder how many other students are like this? Brain chemistry out of whack and one bad day out of an inpatient facility? Enough to have a dedicated form for it.
    I also wonder Kunida is getting out of this. He must've taken the train here. There's no way he's back in Shizukawa before nightfall.
    Finally Kunida and Mana leave, and I'm left with only the view from the window for company.
    
    Time passes in inches.
    While I'm technically not locked in this room, there's nowhere else to go. There's nobody else here in short-term that I'd want to talk to, and nothing to do in the common rooms.
    I dig through my backpack. Nothing much interesting... Notes. Homework, late by now. Lab report... never did hand it in. Flashlight? Did I not return that to Kenta?
    And... Hagami's loaned occultist literature. "A Master-Key to the Mysteries of Ancient and Modern Science and Theology."
    I don't even want to think about her or her strange book.
    There. I unfold the cheap chess board and put it on top, using the book as an improvised stand.
    The pieces I set up on autopilot.
    Whites moves first. I spin the board. Then black. White again.
    It's funny.
    Was this really what I was doing that whole time, all those hours, down in the basement?
    I still don't know whether that would be possible.
    While I could go back and try to remember exactly which memories I have of "Hikari" were my imagination, or my confusion, or something else... I don't think it'd be possible.
    What I remember is what I remember. I played chess with a person called "Hikari," who taught me, lectured me, interrogated me about Mirako, everything else...
    The question the doctors keep trying to answer is whether I still see delusions. They can ask me as much as they want, but as far as I know, everything I've ever seen is real. How should I know if any one memory I have is "fake?" Maybe they all are.
    So I just answer, no, I don't see anybody. She vanished. I haven't talked to anyone called "Hikari" since that night before the ghosthunt. Maybe she did exist and maybe she didn't. All I know is I haven't seen her.
    And hopefully with the new meds I never will see her.
    Another knock on the door. I push the one-sided chess game to the side.
    TAKERU: "Yeah. Come in."
    The door opens but there's nobody there for a moment.
    But after a second one of the nurses enters. Right. Nightly meds. One of the signs that the patients here aren't fully trusted... Guess they're afraid I'll suddenly down all the pills in a fit of suicidal madness or something.
    I take my pills without protest. Just another few days of sitting around here watching dosage...
    Only a few minutes after the door shuts, there's another knock. What did they forget this time.
    TAKERU: "You can come in, it's obviously not locked."
    But there's no answer. Just another knock.
    TAKERU: "Or maybe it is...?"
    I sigh and stand up.
    Opening the door...
    Upon opening the door every instinct tells me to shut it. But my visitor enters the room before I've unpetrified.
    ???: "Hello, Takeru. It's been a few days, hasn't it?"
    TAKERU: "Who are you? What are you doing here?"
    ???: "I came to visit you. You don't have to be rude."
    TAKERU: "Rude? I... have to be seeing things."
    ???: "You know I'm Hikari."
    TAKERU: "There was only one person by the name 'Hikari' and she died a year ago."
    ???: "And that person is me."
    TAKERU: "I give up. I've lost it."
    HIKARI: "A 'hello' would be nice for someone that came all this way just to see you."
    TAKERU: "Yeah, sorry, I've got other things on my mind. Hi."
    TAKERU: "I'm not sure what sort of welcome you were really expecting when I've just been committed to a psych ward for thinking that you exist."
    TAKERU: "I guess I'm hallucinating."
    HIKARI: "Wrong on both counts. From what I can tell you put yourself here by going around Mirako and talking about 'conspirators' and 'sycophants' and trying to justify why you ever saw me in the first place. When I'm not a hallucination."
    TAKERU: "Then I was right? You're just a disguise used by - "
    HIKARI: "No. Don't be stupid."
    HIKARI: "I'm just... me. Miura Hikari. I died at the Mirako school festival almost a year ago, but... it seems I'm still here."
    TAKERU: "So you're claiming to be a ghost."
    HIKARI: "No, I'm..."
    HIKARI: "I don't know what I'm supposed to be. If it helps you to think of me as a ghost, then, fine. Call me a ghost. It's not like I know what happened. I thought my life was over and then I just... woke up the next day. There was no instruction manual."
    TAKERU: "You're... You can't really be saying that... You can't really be here."
    HIKARI: "Yes, that's what I thought at first too."
    HIKARI: "But all the same, I'm still here. Stuck."
    TAKERU: "...Yeah. I've lost it. I'll be stuck here too, in a psyhiatric institute, for life. This is it. You can't really be there."
    HIKARI: "You never did trust me."
    HIKARI: "Hold out your hand, Takeru."
    I hesitate.
    HIKARI: "You don't want to know for sure?"
    TAKERU: "I'll do it. I'll do it, alright. Here."
    I shut my eyes.
    I already know what will happen.
    And I close my hand.
    ...
    Nothing, but then a warmth. Small. Her hand is small, faint, but I can feel a warmth between my fingers.
    TAKERU: "Then you - "
    But when I open my eyes, there's nothing between my fingers.
    The only warmth I could feel was my own hand.
    If this person calling herself "Hikari" is truly in front of me... She's something I can't touch.
    She places her hands behind her back.
    HIKARI: "I was burned a bit before my death, but I lied to you about an injury."
    HIKARI: "My hands don't work because on some level, none of me works. It seems I'm not all here."
    TAKERU: "You're trying to say you're actually a ghost. That's what you mean."
    HIKARI: "If that's how you choose to see things. I suppose that's how I'd describe myself. It's sometimes still surreal even to me..."
    HIKARI: "Do you mind if I sit?"
    TAKERU: "No... Go ahead, I guess."
    My future has gone up in smoke. What do I do now? Act like all my classmates, say I've never met Hikari before in my life? Lie to the shrinks, get out of here? Tell the truth, live my life out in a sanitarium somewhere, forever visited by this acidic person calling herself a ghost?
    HIKARI: "Who were you playing?"
    TAKERU: "What?"
    HIKARI: "The chess match. You look to be mid-game."
    TAKERU: "Nobody. I was bored so I just played both sides. I guess that's what I was doing daily all last month anyway..."
    HIKARI: "Maybe you're more unstable than I thought... Even if I didn't move my pieces myself, you were still playing against me."
    TAKERU: "This is just a little hard to... I don't know. Process?"
    Hikari sits in the chair opposite me, but she doesn't respond except to frown.
    TAKERU: "You get that? Right? I've either got to accept that ghosts are real or that I'm permanently damaged. Psychotic. I'll probably wind up living on the streets or a drunk or..."
    HIKARI: "Hum."
    HIKARI: "If I'm honest... No. I hadn't considered that."
    She stands up again.
    HIKARI: "I've acted selfishly by showing up here. And I suppose I acted selfishly by ever trying to talk to you earnestly in the first place."
    HIKARI: "Maybe I should go. If you need to tell the doctors a story you can say I came and said a few words then left. And that's the last you ever saw of me. A lapse in your prescription caused me to appear and then I disappeared."
    HIKARI: "And then... That would make this goodbye."
    HIKARI: "Would you want that?"
    Want what? Would I prefer that Hikari had never shown up? Sure, that's an obvious answer.
    Or maybe not. Or maybe...
    Who was the first person I ever met at Mirako? Who's been my confidante since I arrived here? Could I pretend I just never -
    HIKARI: "Actually. Don't answer."
    HIKARI: "I know you probably would prefer if I'd never existed but I'm too selfish to respect that."
    TAKERU: "I never said anything like that."
    HIKARI: "It's what you would've said. And it makes sense to me. But try and see this from my perspective."
    HIKARI: "Takeru, my existence was pointless and miserable for a very long time."
    HIKARI: "I tried going to class like normal, carrying on my daily life."
    HIKARI: "And everyone I met acted like they'd never seen me before. I could introduce myself and they'd think I was only an exchange student with a familiar name, and the next day the whole process would repeat again, like any memory of me had been erased."
    HIKARI: "I gave up trying to talk to anyone. I'd spend every day sitting alone in the old wing, hoping to disappear."
    HIKARI: "Do you understand why I'd care so much about one person, even you, just one person happening to remember that I exist from day to day?"
    TAKERU: "I guess. That sounds miserable."
    TAKERU: "So... What? Now I'm cursed too? Anyone I tell about you would think I belong right here, locked up in the loony bin."
    HIKARI: "I'm sorry. I apologize, but I am a weak person."
    HIKARI: "If I wanted to do the right thing, I would never have come back here to see you. I should've never spoken to you in the first place."
    HIKARI: "I tried for a few days and I was just as miserable as I ever was. That's why I'm here. If you really want me to go away forever and never bother you again, then, I guess I can try."
    HIKARI: "But it would hurt. Immensely. Please don't ask me to do that."
    TAKERU: "I..."
    TAKERU: "You don't really give me much of a choice."
    If you backtracked a couple days, I would've said Hikari was my friend, sure as anything. If what she's saying is true, there's no way I would want to to force that on someone I cared about. So of course I can't refuse her here. Especially when she looks that desperate.
    HIKARI: "I'm sorry again. I just..."
    HIKARI: "I can't go back to that. Maybe that's why this happened in the first place and I was turned into... whatever I am now. Too weak or scared to move on to the next life."
    HIKARI: "There's not much I can do for you in return, I'm afraid. Aside from teaching chess. I feel like that skill is a basic."
    TAKERU: "It's... I guess it's fine. You don't have to do anything. You've been a good ear to talk to since I showed up at Mirako."
    I don't even know what I'm saying. It's nonsensical, talking to someone who's already dead.
    TAKERU: "About what happened to you... You are serious, aren't you?"
    HIKARI: "When am I ever not serious?"
    TAKERU: "Then, er..."
    TAKERU: "Maybe I don't see the whole picture. Could you tell me the truth about what happened to you at Mirako?"
    Silence.
    TAKERU: "Sorry. Meiko said it was suicide. I shouldn't - "
    HIKARI: "I never killed myself. I'm too much of a coward for that. How everyone thought I'd committed suicide is baffling to me. I would never."
    TAKERU: "That's just what Meiko told me. Was she lying...?"
    HIKARI: "Oh it's possible they all figured it was suicide, after the way I was acting. And if I'm honest I was probably depressed, but she should know better."
    TAKERU: "Meiko, you mean?"
    HIKARI: "Yes. Her."
    TAKERU: "Where does she fit into all this? She's been acting strange. The night I was at the boathouse she completely blew up at me over you."
    TAKERU: "I'm back at square one. I have no idea what actually happened to you at Mirako."
    Hikari sighs, and for a moment it looks like she's wilting.
    HIKARI: "I don't really like talking about it. I was a stupid, spoiled child. I embarassed myself and died a pointless death, and now everyone rightfully does their best to pretend I didn't exist."
    TAKERU: "I'd still like to know."
    HIKARI: "If you really do... Then I owe it to you to explain myself."
    HIKARI: "Remember I did warn you it isn't interesting."
    
    I was expecting to see the festival, this time last year. Isn't that when everything happened?
    But this...
    At first I don't know where I am. The view... The valley... Oh. The roof of Mirako.
    This might be the exact year to the day I was up here last week. The wind, the weather is right.
    There's someone standing against the side of the stairwell - I jump. But she's not looking at me, she's focused on something back inside Mirako.
    TAKERU: "Hikari?"
    HIKARI: "Oh!"
    She's more startled than I was.
    HIKARI: "I didn't know you were out there."
    HIKARI: "Have you seen Meiko?"
    TAKERU: "No?"
    And she turns around keep watch down the stairs again.
    I wander back inside, but I wonder what I'm supposed to be doing here. I'm sleepy and out place, like I've overslept by hours and hours. Maybe I imagined all that with the ghost hunt, Meiko flipping out, those terrible couple days, the hospital, Hikari...
    Then Meiko walks by, ignoring me completely.
    TAKERU: "Hey!"
    And by completely, I mean completely. She doesn't even glance back at me.
    Did I really offend her that much by visiting the old boathouse?
    Or is this...
    TAKERU: "I'm just a pair of eyes."
    TAKERU: "Fine. You can ignore me if you want, but I'm following you."
    TAKERU: "You got that?"
    No response.
    Meiko climbs the stairs without so much as even faltering.
    TAKERU: "You can ignore me. That's fine. I can understand that. I'll - "
    She vanishes up the stairwell.
    Oh well.
    I can't decide. Can she not see me? Does she choose not to see me? Just how much did I tick her off these past few days?
    Back before I was hospitalized again, before my break... I would've probably said she was
