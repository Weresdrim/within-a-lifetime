label day16:

    The morning is a haze.
    I didn't sleep well at all, but I least I didn't dream. Lucky.
    And speaking of luck, I don't have any visits from psychologists scheduled today. I still have no idea what I'm supposed to tell them.
    I probably have to lie, don't I? Unless I want to live here.
    Should I come up with a story? What do I do if they figure me out?
    My unifinished chess game still sits on top of Hagami's book by the side of my bed. It was a pointless thing anyway so I don't feel the need to finish. Instead I pace around the room for tenth time.
    Twentieth?
    Two hundredth?
    There's a buzz on the intercom. Does that mean I have a guest? Within a few moments, the door opens.
    NATSUMI: "Surprise!"
    TAKERU: "Natsumi!? What on earth are you doing here?"
    NATSUMI: "Of course I'd come to visit my friend in the hospital. You don't have to look so surprised."
    TAKERU: "You're the one who called it a surprise..."
    NATSUMI: "But anyway I was just following Meiko."
    MEIKO: "Hello, Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Hey Meiko... You guys really didn't have to spend your Sunday coming all the way out here."
    NATSUMI: "I spent all the time on the train copying Meiko's lab report, which is all I was going to be doing today anyway."
    NATSUMI: "Besides, we come bearing gifts! Here you go."
    It's a take-out box from a pastry place. Actually, I'm kind of grateful. Anything beats hospital food.
    NATSUMI: "Meiko. Present your gift."
    MEIKO: "These are all the worksheets and assignments you missed this week. And I've made a copy of my notes. Hopefully you won't fall too much more behind."
    TAKERU: "Oh. Thanks."
    NATSUMI: "What's the matter, Takeru? You don't appreciate the gift of homework? My present was much better, right?"
    TAKERU: "Well, yes, but..."
    NATSUMI: "I'm just teasing you."
    I'm overwhelmed.
    Is it common knowledge that I've been institutionalized? I guess it makes sense that Meiko would show up, as my old friend and the class rep, but Natsumi?
    I'd been trying to play my cards close to my chest. If everyone knows I've been stuck at the psych ward for the past week...
    NATSUMI: "So, they're treating you okay? Not sticking you with needles every few minutes?"
    TAKERU: "No. Just pills."
    NATSUMI: "That's not such a bad deal. Kunida's covering logasomethings this week and I think being forcefed pills sounds like it'd be less painful. Maybe even less painful than needles. Maybe you should just hang out here another week until there's a less awful math unit up."
    TAKERU: "..."
    NATSUMI: "Man, Takeru. You're awfully quiet for someon
