label day17:

    The ride back from the clinic.
    Back to Mirako.
    I took this same route almost a month ago, looking out the bus window, watching the countryside give way to suburb, then city, then town, the countryside again as the road following the Shizukawa the last hour or two to Mirako.
    Back then I was apprehensive because there was a totally new life ahead of me and I was uncertain whether I'd fit in or not, and thinking back, I was nervous who I'd be now that I was no longer Takeru, the star pitcher.
    Would I be able to make anything of myself?
    It all seems so stupid in retrospect.
    Why did I care about any of that? Now all I care about is if I'll be able to mend anything with all the people I left behind at Mirako, because I'm pretty sure I remember screwing just about everything with just about everyone.
    What was I even doing those last couple days at Mirako?
    I don't want to dwell on it. Instead I'll just focus on what's ahead.
    TAKERU: "One step at a time."
    TAKERU: "One step... So what's the next step?"
    I'm standing at the bus stop. Mirako is a far ways from what I'd call civilization. Even at this hour the sun is beginning to set.
    Next step, next step... Get out of the damn mental clinic, get back to normal life... Next step.
    I'd say it's pretty obvious what the next step is.
    TAKERU: "Back to the dorms."
    
    I kind of wanted to say the next step was "back home" instead of "back to my dorm room" but it's hard to consider the room I shared with Kenta "home."
    Hell, I wonder if any of my stuff will still be there. Maybe Kenta will have packed it all into long-term storage and turned my half of the room into his own personal trophy gallery. Or sold all my clothes off on an internet auction to pay for a rare butterfly or something.
    The road brings me up to the dorm building. The Shizukawa, as per its name, flows silently behind the three story building along the town's main road.
    I re-met Meiko here, not too many weeks ago, even if she pretended not to know me. I'm half-expecting to run into her again as I trudge past the two or three students outside past the door and up to my old room.
    It's past the afternoon and into the evening now. I didn't see Kenta downstairs at the PC so he should be up here, right?
    But when I knock, no one responds.
    Inside, I'm expecting my bed to have been replaced by an embalming station, but my things are all there. All my shirts, pants, everything... Neatly folded and deposited by the foot of the bed. And I even have my dresser back. No bottled frogs in sight. The thing is empty.
    TAKERU: "Wow..."
    Back on Kenta's half of the room, everything is as disorganized as ever. Boxes full of wood, wooden crates full of boxes, just enough space to squeeze between things to see a bed on the other side...
    I guess it's not disorganized, it's just organized in a way that only make sense to Kenta. I make a note what inspired him to stop trying to take over my half of the room in the same way. In the meantime, I'll just be happy to sleep in an unobstructed bed.
