label day18:

    No burning ruins, no pitcher's mound at Tohoku, no memories from Mirako a year ago.
    My sleep is dreamless.
    Guess the short stint in the clinic was good for something at least... I my new, adjusted cocktail of pills before I even notice Kenta isn't around.
    Well, that makes sense. I set my alarm for a reasonable-for-humans hour, instead of a reasonable-for-Kenta hour. He just let me sleep in for once.
    My shirts are all stacked on the dresser, fully laundered. Did he really let me have some space of my own?
    I peek past the tape divider to Kenta's half of the room, half hidden by boxes. No sign of him. A lot of shipping material over there, but not jarred frogs or any of that nonsense either.
    TAKERU: "This is almost too weird..."
    But not unwelcome.
    I make myself breakfast downstairs and start the walk to school.
    Now that I'm leaving at a normal time, there's actually some activity on the road. Everyone who lives in the dorm heads off in groups of four or five.
    I leave in my group of one.
    Come to think of it...
    It's actually the first time I've made this morning trip without Kenta.
    I catch some chatter.
    STUDENT: "...seriously? But it's just not the Mirako festival without the fireworks show after. Are you absolutely sure you heard from..."
    STUDENT: "...so I'm sure something will come up..."
    STUDENT: "...if the baseball team wins, maybe we'll..."
    I was stupid to think anyone would be talking about me. No one cares or notices that I've returned, thankfully. That'd be embarassing.
    I feel anonymous.
    And very small.
