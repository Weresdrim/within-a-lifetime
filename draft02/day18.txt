label day18:

    No burning ruins, no pitcher's mound at Tohoku, no memories from Mirako a year ago.
    My sleep is dreamless.
    Guess the short stint in the clinic was good for something at least... I my new, adjusted cocktail of pills before I even notice Kenta isn't around.
    Well, that makes sense. I set my alarm for a reasonable-for-humans hour, instead of a reasonable-for-Kenta hour. He just let me sleep in for once.
    My shirts are all stacked on the dresser, fully laundered. Did he really let me have some space of my own?
    I peek past the tape divider to Kenta's half of the room, half hidden by boxes. No sign of him. A lot of shipping material over there, but not jarred frogs or any of that nonsense either.
    TAKERU: "This is almost too weird..."
    But not unwelcome.
    I make myself breakfast downstairs and start the walk to school.
    Now that I'm leaving at a normal time, there's actually some activity on the road. Everyone who lives in the dorm heads off in groups of four or five.
    I leave in my group of one.
    Come to think of it...
    It's actually the first time I've made this morning trip without Kenta.
    I catch some chatter.
    STUDENT: "...seriously? But it's just not the Mirako festival without the fireworks show after. Are you absolutely sure you heard right..."
    STUDENT: "...so I'm sure something will come up..."
    STUDENT: "...if the baseball team wins, maybe we'll..."
    I was stupid to think anyone would be talking about me. No one cares or notices that I've returned, thankfully. That'd be embarassing.
    All the same... I feel anonymous.
    And very small.
    
    I've hardly set foot in class when something hits me full in the chest.
    TAKERU: "Oof!"
    NATSUMI: "Hey hey, welcome back Takeru."
    TAKERU: "What was that supposed to be?"
    NATSUMI: "A hug? From your old buddy Natsumi?"
    TAKERU: "Well whatever it was you knocked the wind straight out of me..."
    NATSUMI: "Still not a hundred percent, eh?"
    TAKERU: "It was my head that was screwed up, not my lungs. Although my lungs are going to be screwed up now after you bodyslammed me..."
    NATSUMI: "Oh who cares about that, as long as your arm's not injured. Did you know, there's three days to go?"
    TAKERU: "Three days to what now?"
    NATSUMI: "The regional tournie. Come on, I even told you about this when I came to visit. This is the first time Mirako's baseball team's been invited since - "
    TAKERU: "Oh, right, yeah, that..."
    I'm treated to a full summary of the tournament bracket, plus details about Kenta's opposition research and other triva I'd rather not hear from Natsumi at the moment.
    It's annoying. This was Jun's favorite season too. That guy lived to scout. 
    Why am I even thinking about that right now? It's irrelevant. More importantly - 
    TAKERU: "Hey, where's Meiko?"
    NATSUMI: "Huh? Oh, yeah I guess it's weird she's not in yet. I haven't heard anything, so I'd expect her to be in to day. I wouldn't expect her to be as thrilled that you're back as me, though. I'm pretty thrilled, you see."
    TAKERU: "Yeah, that's great."
    I like Natsumi well enough as a fellow slacker and fellow victim of Kunida's math class, but when she's talking baseball, my patience is thin. And this morning, listening to her is especially offputting.
    NATSUMI: "Wait, that's Meiko now."
    NATSUMI: "Hey. Hey, Meiko! Look!"
    Natsumi waves but Meiko ignores her and heads straight for the front of the class for this morning's speech.
    MEIKO: "Hello everyone. Good morning. I hope you're all looking forward to this year's summer festival as much as I am. If you're not involved in a club, we still have some open volunteer spots with..."
    The same old stuff. My attention drifts until I catch my name.
    MEIKO: "And if everyone could join me in welcoming Ichiro Takeru back to our class, I'd be grateful. We're all glad to see you Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Oh, er, uh... It's good to be back. Hi everyone."
    I sit back down after a few murmurs and nods from the class. Natsumi soon follows and sits next to me.
    And while I wait for her to say anything... She doesn't talk. Just stares at her desk.
    TAKERU: "Meiko?"
    TAKERU: "Thanks for the welcome. I was sort of trying to slip in without anyone... Meiko?"
    She just keeps staring. I glance at Natsumi, but she just shrugs.
    Mr. Kunida begins the lecture and Meiko busies herself taking notes.
    I guess this makes sense. Why would she want to speak to me? When we last talked in the hospital she sounded pretty damn hostile, and I'm not sure if I should apologize, or... Or...
    What does she even want from me?
    Should I even try to explain myself?
    I'm saved the trouble of thinking what to say to her - when morning classes end, Meiko simply disappears out the door.
    
    I think I'd call it deja vu. Standing here outside a classroom, watching the school milling around, waiting for nothing, feeling like an alien... It was Hikari's memory, I think. I saw it when she showed up in the hospital. Why do I feel like I'm retracing those steps?
    NATSUMI: "Well you sure are a sorry sight."
    TAKERU: "Natsumi?"
