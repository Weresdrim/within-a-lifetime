label day19:

    Another dreamless night. I could get used to this.
    What I might not be able to get used to is the absence of Kenta. My half of the room is still empty chests of drawers and stacks of folded clothing from where Kenta removed it from our shared furniture.
    His half is as rigidly segmented as before. Except now there are a lot more shipping boxes than I remember, and a couple of random slabs of wood lying around. Plus what looks like an old-fashioned clock sitting on his desk?
    Regardless, I wake up as Kenta is about to leave. It almost looks like he's tiptoeing across the room with his back to the wall.
    TAKERU: "Kenta? What are you doing?"
    KENTA: "..."
    TAKERU: "Kenta?"
    TAKERU: "Are you not talking to me?"
    KENTA: "You're the one who told me not to talk to you. You can't get angry at me if I'm doing something you told me to do."
    TAKERU: "I told you not to talk to me? I think this is the first time I've spoken to you since I've been back."
    KENTA: "Yes, and before you left you explicitly said, 'Don't talk to me unless it's to tell you the truth about - '"
    TAKERU: "Okay, just forget whatever I said before I left. I was at the mental health clinic out in the city. I'm surprised they didn't put a psychiatric hold on me. I wasn't speaking what I meant, okay?"
    KENTA: "Then I should talk to you?"
    TAKERU: "You shouldn't not not talk to me."
    KENTA: "I don't know whether to believe you now, or believe you from a week ago, when you said you never wanted to hear my opinion again, regardless of whatever happened in the future. It's mixed messages."
    TAKERU: "Look, just forget it."
    KENTA: "I can't force myself to forget something that I clearly remember even if - "
    TAKERU: "What are you doing walking like that anyway? You look like a catburglar."
    KENTA: "I'm not stepping on your side of the room. But the door is on your side of the room. You only claimed the floor as your territory, so I assume the wall is a neutral zone."
    TAKERU: "A neutral... What?"
    TAKERU: "You can just walk normally. You look ridiculous."
    KENTA: "I hear that a lot."
    TAKERU: "Check yourself in the mirror once in a while. Your shirt is on backwards."
    KENTA: "No one would notice something like that."
    TAKERU: "Everyone but you notices things like that, Kenta. Just fix your shirt and let me sleep in a couple minutes longer."
    KENTA: "If you sleep any longer, you'll - "
    KENTA: "I forgot. You said - "
    KENTA: "Never mind."
    I half-watch, half-sleep as Kenta shuffles around in his shirt while still standing tip-toe against the wall. If he topples over, I'm not going to break the fall for him.
    Eventually he stumbles out of the room and closes the door.
    I'm not sure what exactly to do about Kenta. He's a lot more liveable now, but this seems a bit ridiculous.
    And when I'm finally ready to get up, I notice there's a new set of fully-laundered clothes where I found my uniform yesterday. He can't be doing laundry daily, can he?
    I don't have the brain cycles to spare on Kenta for the moment. Instead I head downstairs to find breakfast.
    Normally this when Kenta and I would catch up, if he didn't have some online auction to close out around this time of the morning. Instead I eat alone again.
    I'm still caught up on what Hikari said yesterday night, about if I had the chance, I should try to fix things with everyone.
    Easy for her to say. What would I even say to Kenta? What did I even say to him last week, before I was committed? Isn't it better to have him tiptoeing around me and giving me space, versus Kenta before, who had no concept of personal boundaries?
    I'm not sure about that. But it's me who's eating alone.
    
    When I show up at home room, it's on the heels of Natsumi.
    I would rather she didn't notice me, but, too late.
    NATSUMI: "Hey. Hey Takeru!"
    NATSUMI: "Pretending not to hear me, huh?"
    TAKERU: "..."
    NATSUMI: "I heard something neat."
    NATSUMI: "You heard about the fireworks this year, didn't you? Canceled? By order of the principal or something like that?"
    NATSUMI: "Well, did you hear it or not?"
    TAKERU: "..."
    NATSUMI: "Oh come on. This has nothing to do with baseball. Even if you're going to be a stick in the mud I'm just going to keep talking to you anyway, and there's nothing you can do about it."
    TAKERU: "Then hurry up and give your speech or whatever it is you want to do."
    NATSUMI: "A speech? Me? Ha, you've been spending too much time with Meiko. This is just a rumor. Has to do with Meiko though. Interested?"
    TAKERU: "Not really."
    NATSUMI: "They're saying there's really no fireworks show this year. My left fielder is on the festival committee, and he saw the schedule draft, and there's just a big talk from the principal or something scheduled."
    TAKERU: "Meiko's been telling you that for weeks."
    NATSUMI: "She was obviously bluffing for a big surprise show."
    NATSUMI: "Or I'm sure if someone close to her suggested a big surprise show as an idea, she'd get the principal to change his mind on it, yeah?"
    TAKERU: "I was starting to wonder why you were bothering to talk to me, but of course, it's because you want me to do something for you."
    NATSUMI: "Where'd that cynical streak come from?"
    I don't bother responding, but Natsumi keeps nattering away.
    She'd really fit right in at Tohoku. She only talks to me because she sees some advantage for herself in doing so.
    NATSUMI: "Hey. Hey Meiko!"
    MEIKO: "Good morning Natsumi."
    NATSUMI: "Tell Takeru he needs to stick up for his buddy."
    MEIKO: "Hm?"
    TAKERU: "I'm not your buddy."
    MEIKO: "Yeah, you're not my pal, friend you're my... Hang on, how did that go?"
    That doesn't warrant a response. I glance at Meiko, but... She's not looking at me at all.
    I guess we haven't spoken since I've been back.
    NATSUMI: "Okay, okay, never mind. Meiko! What's with the fireworks this year? I'm supposed to be your best friend and I haven't heard about the surprise show. There is a surprise show, right? Right?"
    MEIKO: "I don't know where you've been getting these ideas."
    NATSUMI: "Because the Mirako Summer Festival without the Mirako Summer Fireworks would be unthinkable. It's tradition!"
    MEIKO: "It's also not my call. I'm sorry, I really am. If I thought I could change the principal's mind, I would."
    NATSUMI: "Meiko! You're the most convincing person I know! You're sincere, well-spoken, you know what to say to people. Give it a try. Tell the staff that - "
    MEIKO: "Hold that thought. I need to start class."
    She leaves her seat to make the morning announcements without so much at a glance at me.
    NATSUMI: "Okay, first thing, what's up with you guys? Are you not talking to Meiko? Or is Meiko not talking to you?"
    TAKERU: "For one thing, I am not talking to you."
    NATSUMI: "Sure you are. I'll just grill Meiko on it later so you might as well tell me now."
    TAKERU: "Go away."
    NATSUMI: "Never mind, never mind. Second thing! She can't be serious about the fireworks, can she?"
    TAKERU: "You're terrible. I sure bet they're canceled, if last year someone died."
    Natsumi recoils.
    TAKERU: "Sorry, is everyone just pretending to forget all about that? I don't want to be insensitive."
    NATSUMI: "What's with you today? Sometimes I don't know what Meiko sees in you."
    TAKERU: "She doesn't see anything. Trust me."
    TAKERU: "And the cancelation is her idea. The staff isn't involved. It's just her."
    NATSUMI: "No way. How do you know that? Why do you know that?"
    TAKERU: "Mr. Kunida said it. It was Meiko's call."
    NATSUMI: "Aha! Thanks! Guess you're good for something after all."
    TAKERU: "..."
    NATSUMI: "That was a joke. A joke! You're good for - "
    I tune her out.
    Don't ask me why I told her any of that.
    Maybe just because it's Meiko. I can't ask her about any of this, about why she's doing anything, about why she despises Hikari as much as she does, about any of this. I can't bring my self to do it.
    Natsumi, however, is absolutely tactless.
    And I realize what I've said is almost a betrayal of Meiko, but...
    I'm still thinking over what I said, and what I shouldn't have said, as Meiko returns to her seat.
    NATSUMI: "Meiko. Hey Meiko!"
    MEIKO: "Natsumi?"
    NATSUMI: "So I just heard from Takeru..."
    MEIKO: "Hm?"
    She still doesn't look at me.
    NATSUMI: "Fireworks. You canceled them?"
    MEIKO: "Natsumi, I'm on your side in this. If I thought I could get them rescheduled for this year, I - "
    NATSUMI: "According to my good friend Mr. Kunida and my even better friend Takeru, the call for fireworks or no fireworks comes completely down to one Kotaru Meiko."
    MEIKO: "What?"
    NATSUMI: "Takeru said so himself. You mean you're the one to call off the fireworks?"
    MEIKO: "Me?"
    NATSUMI: "Yeah! You! You're gonna tell me Takeru lied to me? You think this guy has the backbone to lie to his old pal Natsumi about something like this?"
    Around this point is when I realize just how seriously I've screwed up.
    NATSUMI: "Why'd you do it? We have to have fireworks. It's just not Mirako without the biggest event of the year. You mean you're going to call it all off over... that?"
    MEIKO: "That what?"
    NATSUMI: "Her."
    NATSUMI: "That, she, whatever she - "
    MEIKO: "Class is starting."
    Sure enough Kunida is at the front of the room now, starting to explain some formula that I've never seen before and hopefully won't ever again.
    I'm more paying attention to Natsumi, whose attention keeps swapping between Meiko and me. Eventually she settles on Meiko.
    As math ends, English ends, and lunch begins, it's Meiko who Natsumi trails out to the hall, not me.
    The two stand there. Bickering? I hear raised voices. Mostly Nastumi's voice. I thought Meiko was incapable of raising her voice until that day in the hospital, but, that seems to be happening now.
    I underestimated her.
    Eventually, Natsumi laughs and walks off down the hall with a couple of guys from the baseball team.
    Maybe they've sorted things out? That's what I think until Meiko turns my direction.
    As soon as she makes eye contact I turn away.
    It wasn't anger I saw in her eyes.
    Not really confusion either.
    Just a pure neutral. "I know." That's what she was saying, Meiko.
    "I know what you did. I understand why. I'll get even."
    It scares me.
    
    When it comes time for lunch, I flee the classroom as soon as possible. No way I'm sticking around to deal with Meiko, if she'd even deign to talk to me. Or Natsumi. I couldn't possibly explain myself.
    I couldn't explain why I said anything if I even wanted to. Natsumi has shown her trues colors, nothing matters to her but herself.
    Meiko is more... I realize I don't understand her. And it feels like I never will.
    I'm standing outside the classroom when she leaves, and briefly we brush shoulders.
    TAKERU: "Meiko?"
    MEIKO: "..."
    And it hardly seems like she's mad. She doesn't make eye contact. Just stares at the ground, and walks out.
    TAKERU: "Meiko? Hey, Meiko, hold on a second!"
    But she doesn't respond.
    I'm left standing in front of the staircase.
    At first I have a sense of deja vu. I've stood here before.
    But I realize that time was a memory. Hikari's memory.
    Looking after Meiko, idling down the hallway one step at a time, but me (and Hikari's old memory) stuck in some sort of repeat.
    I just need to get away from class. And I can't go to the old library unless I want to face Hagami and Mana, so eventually I end up...
    ...just pacing the basement. One step back and forth.
    There's no external sign of Hagami. I know somehow that if I want to search for her, I'll find her, standing behind me, needling me for looking after her, as usual.
    The tea room is as abandoned as it's ever been. The boxes lined up in shelves on the wall, the table untouched. There's no sign of the teacups I could've sworn I used last night. But who could've washed them? Hikari? She wouldn't have been able to - 
    HIKARI: "Takeru?"
    TAKERU: "Oh, it's you."
    HIKARI: "Who else would it be?"
    TAKERU: "I don't know. I sort of figured, after last night..."
    HIKARI: "That I wouldn't be talking to you."
    TAKERU: "Well..."
    TAKERU: "Kind of."
    HIKARI: "Hum."
    She doesn't say anything more, just trails off and wanders into the tea romm.
    I guess I'm supposed to follows.
    Hikari is still visible when I enter, sitting, but starting at the table. She must notice me, because she gestures to a shelf.
    HIKARI: "All the rest of the tea is there. I won't make you buy any more yourself. I know you don't enjoy it."
    TAKERU: "I mean, I wouldn't say I don't enjoy. It just all tastes the same to - "
    HIKARI: "You don't enjoy it."
    She continues staring at the table.
    TAKERU: "It's not really what I meant."
    HIKARI: "It's fine. I've decided I forgive you."
