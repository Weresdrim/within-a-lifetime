label day19:

    Another dreamless night. I could get used to this.
    What I might not be able to get used to is the absence of Kenta. My half of the room is still empty chests of drawers and stacks of folded clothing from where Kenta removed it from our shared furniture.
    His half is as rigidly segmented as before. Except now there are a lot more shipping boxes than I remember, and a couple of random slabs of wood lying around. Plus what looks like an old-fashioned clock sitting on his desk?
    Regardless, I wake up as Kenta is about to leave. It almost looks like he's tiptoeing across the room with his back to the wall.
    TAKERU: "Kenta? What are you doing?"
    KENTA: "..."
    TAKERU: "Kenta?"
    TAKERU: "Are you not talking to me?"
    KENTA: "You're the one who told me not to talk to you. You can't get angry at me if I'm doing something you told me to do."
    TAKERU: "I told you not to talk to me? I think this is the first time I've spoken to you since I've been back."
    KENTA: "Yes, and before you left you explicitly said, 'Don't talk to me unless it's to tell you the truth about - '"
    TAKERU: "Okay, just forget whatever I said before I left. I was at the mental health clinic out in the city. I'm surprised they didn't put a psychiatric hold on me. I wasn't speaking what I meant, okay?"
    KENTA: "Then I should talk to you?"
    TAKERU: "You shouldn't not not talk to me."
    KENTA: "I don't know whether to believe you now, or believe you from a week ago, when you said you never wanted to hear my opinion again, regardless of whatever happened in the future. It's mixed messages."
    TAKERU: "Look, just forget it."
    KENTA: "I can't force myself to forget something that I clearly remember even if - "
    TAKERU: "What are you doing walking like that anyway? You look like a catburglar."
    KENTA: "I'm not stepping on your side of the room. But the door is on your side of the room. You only claimed the floor as your territory, so I assume the wall is a neutral zone."
    TAKERU: "A neutral... What?"
    TAKERU: "You can just walk normally. You look ridiculous."
    KENTA: "I hear that a lot."
    TAKERU: "Check yourself in the mirror once in a while. Your shirt is on backwards."
    KENTA: "No one would notice something like that."
    TAKERU: "Everyone but you notices things like that, Kenta. Just fix your shirt and let me sleep in a couple minutes longer."
    KENTA: "If you sleep any longer, you'll - "
    KENTA: "I forgot. You said - "
    KENTA: "Never mind."
    I half-watch, half-sleep as Kenta shuffles around in his shirt while still standing tip-toe against the wall. If he topples over, I'm not going to break the fall for him.
    Eventually he stumbles out of the room and closes the door.
    I'm not sure what exactly to do about Kenta. He's a lot more liveable now, but this seems a bit ridiculous.
    And when I'm finally ready to get up, I notice there's a new set of fully-laundered clothes where I found my uniform yesterday. He can't be doing laundry daily, can he?
    I don't have the brain cycles to spare on Kenta for the moment. Instead I head downstairs to find breakfast.
    Normally this when Kenta and I would catch up, if he didn't have some online auction to close out around this time of the morning. Instead I eat alone again.
    I'm still caught up on what Hikari said yesterday night, about if I had the chance, I should try to fix things with everyone.
    Easy for her to say. What would I even say to Kenta? What did I even say to him last week, before I was committed? Isn't it better to have him tiptoeing around me and giving me space, versus Kenta before, who had no concept of personal boundaries?
    I'm not sure about that. But it's me who's eating alone.
    
    When I show up at home room, it's on the heels of Natsumi.
    I would rather she didn't notice me, but, too late.
    NATSUMI: "Hey. Hey Takeru!"
    NATSUMI: "Pretending not to hear me, huh?"
    TAKERU: "..."
    NATSUMI: "I heard a rumor."
    NATSUMI: "You heard about the fireworks this year, didn't you? Canceled? By order of the principal or something like that?"
    NATSUMI: "Well, did you hear?"
    TAKERU: "..."
    NATSUMI: "Oh come on. This has nothing to do with baseball. Even if you're going to be a stick in the mud I'm just going to keep talking to you anyway, and there's nothing you can do about it."
