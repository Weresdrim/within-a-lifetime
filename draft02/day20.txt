    Normally, in the morning, the dorm window provides a view of the river Shizukawa.
    Today is abnormal for two reasons. First, outside the window is just a bank of fog. Some storm must be passing over the mountain, because even if isn't raining, it looks like a cloud has parked itself over the entire town.
    Second thing: Kenta is still here, and it's under and hour until class starts.
    TAKERU: "Kenta?"
    He's definitely still here. I can hear him rummaging around, even if the huge cardboard box from yesterday is blocking my line of sight.
    KENTA: "Takeru! I don't have time for you."
    TAKERU: "What?"
    KENTA: "I closed an auction ten minutes ago and now I'm short on time. I don't care what mixed messages you have for me today. This is dire."
    TAKERU: "...What?"
    Maybe I'm still dreaming.
    KENTA: "Yes. I needed a specific gear for - "
    He shuts his mouth and jumps like he just realized something. And just like yesterday, he puts his back to the wall and creeps out the door.
    TAKERU: "Kenta! You have your undershirt on over your coat! And where's your tie? What are you - "
    The door slams.
    TAKERU: "This is even more tiring than when he actually did try to talk to me..."
    I'm about to start scrounging around for fresh clothing when I notice Kenta has done all the laundry, and my share is sitting by the foot of my bed.
    Convenient. But still, this is the guy that worried enough about be that he was concerned he was sending the right variety of underwear my way while I was holed up at a mental hospital. I don't need him doing my laundry,
    Just put it on the end of that huge list of "unpleasant things I need to sort out with unpleasant people." Since I've been back it just keeps on growing.
    
    Kenta is long gone by the time I'm on the road.
    Luckily I have the road memorized or I'd have no idea where to go. The fog is absolutely oppressive. And the humidity has me sweating through my shirt.
    As I cross the bridge, there's no sign of the ruin downriver, or even trees downriver at a distance of more than a few meters.
    Summer here is going to be an absolute chore.
    When I show up in homeroom, Meiko's desk is still empty. Natsumi, though, spots me and immediately ignores me and starts some conversation with the girl in the row in front of us.
    And I couldn't care less.
    Until she starts pointedly glancing at me.
    NATSUMI: "...So we're headed out today for Iwate for the first round in the tournament."
    NATSUMI: "...Not that certain people have helped...
    NATSUMI: "...Nope. Still got that gap in out starting rotation. It's not gonna be pretty."
    Etcetera.
    I couldn't care less about ignoring Natsumi. She deserves whatever's coming to her in the summer tournament series.
    What's more surprising to me is when Meiko arrives, Natsumi's attention shifts off me completely. And she begins a completely unrelated conversation with some baseball guy in the next row, but in the exact same tone of voice.
    NATSUMI: "...Nope, no fireworks this year."
    NATSUMI: "...But I hear it wasn't the staff. Talk to the festival committee."
    NATSUMI: "...Who's on the committee? Well, our class rep is of course. Maybe talk to her. Weird that the festival committee would cancel the thing completely, huh?"
    Etcetera.
    Go figure. Natsumi is the least subtle person I know, so it's hard for her to hide when she's annoyed with someone. And she's annoyed with both me and Meiko.
    So she doesn't even look in either direction at either of us until the start of lunch and says her goodbyes. The bus leaves at noon, apparently.
    And when she's gone, it's just Meiko and I sitting next to each other, with an empty desk between us, staring straight ahead.
    
    The lunch break is a relief.
    I'm fully prepared to continue ignoring Meiko as much as she's ignoring me. But I'm stopped at the door.
    MEIKO: "Hey."
    TAKERU: "Meiko?"
    MEIKO: "Hey Takeru."
    Eye contact with her is an act of defiance.
    MEIKO: "You... So..."
    TAKERU: "What?"
    MEIKO: "Let's get lunch. My treat."
    TAKERU: "Alright?"
    It's only a second of vulnerability before she's back to the Meiko that gave today's class announcements. Unquestionable.
    Meiko's treat turns out to only be the cafeteria, and it's not like she says anything to me the whole time we order and walk upstairs to the roof.
    Despite the weather, the top of the Mirako school remains empty. Today, the only difference is there is no view. 
    Meiko and I eat in silence. If she were to lean backwards, I wonder if I'd even be able to see her in front of me.
    This is terrible. I shouldn't have agreed to this. The silence is just as oppressive as the fog. What should I say?"
    TAKERU: "Hey. About when I was in the clinic."
    MEIKO: "...?"
    TAKERU: "Thanks for coming to visit."
    She doesn't respond, aside from a sigh.
    TAKERU: "Maybe I should apologize. I've been caught up trying to sort my own things out"
    TAKERU: "I don't deny any of the things they said in the hospital, if that's what you're here for."
    TAKERU: "I told them I saw things, and I didn't elaborate on what those 'things' were. Is that good enough?"
    TAKERU "...No? I didn't mention her name."
    But I don't think Meiko was even listening. Because she's rummaging through her bag, and eventually produces two page stapled together.
    MEIKO: "Do you know who this is for? The recepient?
    TAKERU: "Recipient?"
    It almost looks like a letter. It's on official stationary anyway, and addressed to...
    TAKERU: "Mana?"
    MEIKO" "
