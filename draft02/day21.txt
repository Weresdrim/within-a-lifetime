label day21:

    Regardless of what that cloud or mist or whatver was yesterday, it's cleared by morning. The Shizukawa is back outside the dorm window, same as usual.
    What isn't usual is that while it's close enough to the start of class that I'm waking up, but Kenta is still asleep.
    TAKERU: "Uh... Kenta?"
    Normally he'd be leaving right about now... But as far as I can tell, he's still passed on his bed at the other ends of the room, between more of the heavy, upright boxes like the one I dragged in yesterday.
    Do I wake him up?
    It seems like something likely to backfire...
    But then I remember my first week here where Kenta decided to act as my alarm clock and jab me in the forehead whenever he thought I was sleeping in too late. If he complains, I've got that to use against him.
    TAKERU: "Kenta. Hey. Kenta, you'll be late if you keep sleeping."
    KENTA: "Huah..."
    KENTA: "Late? Hang on, late?"
    KENTA: "You, what time is it?"
    TAKERU: "It's almost - "
    KENTA: "Why didn't you get me up sooner? This is a disaster. I was up all night trying to close on that 1890 Brandenburg model and I must've forgotten to set my alarms."
    KENTA: "Hurry. Can you pass me a pair of socks?"
    TAKERU: "There's still plenty of time. This is when I'd like to be getting up, if you weren't always so early..."
    TAKERU: "And how am I supposed to know where your socks are? Aren't they on your side of the line anyway?"
    KENTA: "Oh. The line. Of course."
    TAKERU: "I didn't mean you had to stop talking to - "
    KENTA: "The line is like a wall. One can't talk through a wall or see through a wall, so we can't interact right now."
    TAKERU: "Who came up with this idea..."
    
    Of course, it's probably me who came up with the idea, when I was not at all thinking correctly two weeks ago.
    So even while this is the first time since I've been back that I've made the morning commute with Kenta, I don't have much to say to him.
    What's more surprising is he doesn't say anything to me either. Usually I'd be extremely well-informed on his new collection of the week at this point.
    TAKERU: "You're quiet this morning."
