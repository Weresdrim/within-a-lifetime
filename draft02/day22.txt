label day22

    It's Saturday. Just a half day to go, and it'll mark a full week to go since I've been back at Mirako, a full week without bizarre dreams of versions of the past I should've never seen... A full week where the only person I've been able to really talk to is Hikari.
    Well. And Kenta I guess. Maybe.
    KENTA: "If you keep sitting there in bed like that you'll be late."
    TAKERU: "I'm awake. I'd have to sit here for another full hour if I wanted to be late."
    KENTA: "Why would you want to be late?"
    TAKERU: "No, that's not what I meant. I don't want to be late. I meant - "
    KENTA: "If you don't want to be late then hurry up and get dressed. I'll be downstairs. I need to check my bids."
    
    We walk the bridge across the Shizukawa together, and then up the road to Mirako.
    One of the downsides of reconciling with Kenta is that now I'm back on his personal schedule. The school is deserted at this hour.
    We don't run into anyone until we arrive on the second floor where the second-year classrooms are. It looks like... Meiko? I'm not sure if I should try to make myself scarce, but Kenta walks straight up to her.
    KENTA: "Good morning.
    MEIKO: "Oh, good morning Kenta. And hello Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Hey. Good morning."
    But I give my greeting through gritted teeth. I've no doubt she's the reason why the supernatural club is going extinct.
    KENTA: "I heard you're on the festival committee."
    MEIKO: "That's right. Your application was approved, by the way. I just need to work out the final position but you should have some display space somewhere in the gym."
    TAKERU: "Kenta, you're part of a club?"
    KENTA: "Don't be silly."
    TAKERU: "But you're displaying at the - "
    KENTA: "It's a personal display permit. I have permission to sell my work at the festival as well. No club needed."
    MEIKO: "I'll look forward to what you'll bring."
    TAKERU: "Yeah... What is it you'll be showing off, exactly?"
    Because whatever it is, it's probably going to be living in my room for the next week or two. I cross my fingers. As long as it's not more pickled dead things. Or dead things in general. Or something that will stink up the room. Or - 
    KENTA: "Clocks, probably."
    MEIKO: "That sounds interesting."
    It sounds boring as hell, but that's in my best interest.
    KENTA: "I also heard you suspended the fireworks."
    MEIKO: "The staff decided that for - "
    KENTA: "It's smart of you. Fireworks are unsafe. Anyone should know that after last year. I'm glad nobody is letting their sentiment get in the way of making the right choice."
    MEIKO: "...Yeah."
    MEIKO: "Thank you for letting me know. Let's talk later, alright Kenta?"
    Meiko bows out.
    TAKERU: "So you can present at the festival without a club..."
    KENTA: "Of course. You just need to apply. Will you be displaying your coin collection?"
    TAKERU: "What? No."
    KENTA: "Just yesterday you were saying you wished you had gotten into collection coins. I think showing off something that at the festival would be a great start."
    TAKERU: "Never mind. Forget the coins."
    TAKERU: "Kenta, just a quick question... What all happened at last year's festival, with the fireworks?"
    KENTA: "Hasn't anyone told you that already?"
    TAKERU: "Yeah, but I figure you're the person least likely to get sentiment get in the way of telling what really happened."
    KENTA: "Fair."
    KENTA: "If I had to sum it up... One of the girls in our year stole some fireworks and managed to kill herself with them."
    TAKERU: "Was it intentional?"
    KENTA: "Oh, probably. You know girls our age are. All emotional and everything."
    TAKERU: "I... let's just ignore that."
    KENTA: "The point is, fireworks are inherently unsafe, so the festival committee made the correct decision. That's all there is to it. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to get to class before I'm late."
    He files into the classroom next to mine as I scowl after him.
    It's the most Kenta response ever, but it doesn't give me any insight into Hikari at all. Or any clue why Meiko would decide that this year is the year to break Mirako's tradition. No way she shares Kenta's reasoning.
