label day30:

    I sleep well.
    Maybe those meds are finally doing the trick -- I can't remember the last time I've dreamt of anything, let alone those scenes of the baseball diamond that used to haunt me.
    Or maybe it's that Kenta hasn't woken me up recently, and so I don't remember my dreams. He's not here this morning, either. Without Kenta, the clocks, the frogs, or the zillion other things that used to weird up the room, it's almost like normal people live here.
    Except getting out of bed I step on a piece of precisely-folded paper.
    TAKERU: "Oh now what?"
    It's a grid with today's date at the top and blocked out into half hour chunks. A schedule? Looks like Kenta's penciled in some modifications.
    Today is a half day, and Kenta's labeled every class. But before class starts, and in the entire afternoon afterwards...
    TAKERU: "'Prepare Display Table...' 'Transport Goods...' Is he really preparing for the festival all day?  And that lunatic started at 5:00 AM?"
    TAKERU: "The school can't be open that early, he's nuts..."
    I guess this is Kenta's way of telling me where he went. Why'd he leave it on my
    Putting that mystery aside, I check the clock. It's still early, but there's no chance of getting back to sleep. I passed out last night, but now there's too much on my mind.
    I throw on my clothes and get ready to leave. If I'm early, I can always check what new horrors Kenta is prepping for the festival.
    It's a clear morning, and quiet.
    Unfortunately with Kenta not around, all I've got for company are my own thoughts.
    What I'd like to say is that they're all about how I have a day left to convince Meiko to go ahead with the fireworks display, and that I was hatching some plot to win her over.
    But my thoughts are with Meiko.
    I think I understand her, now, at least a little more. If cancelling the show in return for a moment of silence is the path for to memorialize Hikari, once her best friend...
    It seems unfair to rob her of that moment.
    If I want to preserve Hikari's memory, wouldn't that be for the best? Cancel the fireworks, force everyone to remember the girl they're trying so hard to forget?
    But even that's not what's on my mind. Last night, Meiko said when we were kids, she saw me as a hero figure. If she had asked me what I thought of her back then, I would've said...
    I didn't think of her at all, really. Just another friend among dozens.
    And something in me wants to change that now. I want her to be free of whatever has her on the edge of a nervous breakdown.
    But why am I thinking of that? I need to concentrate on coming up with a plan. Get with it, Takeru. If I can't get this right, Hikari could disappear altogether. I can't let that happen.
    
    But I show up at Mirako with nothing in mind, and with my eyes on the ground.
    It's a bad day to not pay attention where I'm going. Even early in the day, there's a swarm of activity -- students putting up signs, dragging carts to the gym or out to the display area, arriving, rehearsing, chatting, milling, planning... Only 24 hours before festival day.
    But I'm not paying attention so I wander directly into a tall, muscluar person blocking the hall.
    TAKERU: "Sorry, my fault, I wasn't paying - "
    TAKERU: "Kenta!"
    KENTA: "Good morning."
    TAKERU: "Why are you just standing there? You take up like half the hall. Are you just looking for people to stumble into you?"
    KENTA: "Good morning."
    TAKERU: "What?"
    KENTA: "You're supposed to say 'good morning.' I've been told it's impolite to talk about business before greeting someone."
    TAKERU: "Good morning Kenta. Now why are you blocking the hall?"
    KENTA: "I was waiting for you. You were supposed to be here two hours ago. Didn't you get the schedule?"
    TAKERU: "Oh, you left it on my bed. I should've brought it with me I guess but I didn't know you lost it. Did you really schedule all your time today in half hour blocks? That takes some dedication. I don't know why - "
    KENTA: "I have my own schedule. That one was yours!"
    TAKERU: "Wait what? I don't remember making a schedule."
    KENTA: "No, of course you wouldn't have the foresight to do that so I made it for you. You're welcome."
    KENTA: "But you haven't followed any of it! You were supposed to help me set up the display table hours ago. And after that, we had to move the - "
    TAKERU: "You can't just write something up for me like that and expect me to follow it. You would've had to talk to me. And tell me why you thought I'd spend all day getting you set up for the festival. And convince me why waking up at 5:00AM was necessary."
    KENTA: "You'd have to be up earlier than that. That's when the first block starts."
    TAKERU: "Never mind. I'll pitch in where I can but I'm not putting my whole day on hold to work on your clocks. Sorry."
    KENTA: "Then I should mention I have a schedule for us tomorrow on festival day."
    TAKERU: "Us? Schedule yourself but I'm not doing that either."
    KENTA: "I can't man the table all day. It takes shiftwork. Hey, where are you going?"
    TAKERU: "Look, sorry, I have other things to deal with. And class is starting."
    That gets to him, at least. After a quick goodbye, Kenta darts down the hall to his own homeroom while I take a seat in mine.
    Hikari is here, seated in the back. I can tell she notices me enter, because she turns away, pretending to be lost in her headphones.
    Meiko and Natsumi are already there as well, Natsumi talking with the baseball player in front of us, and Meiko sitting in silence, at least until I sit down and she offers half a grin and:
    MEIKO: "Hi."
    TAKERU: "Hey. Good morning."
    MEIKO: "Thanks for bearing with me last night. I'm afraid I probably said too much, so..."
    MEIKO: "It's alright if you'd rather forget that. Let's just... be like we were before."
    TAKERU: "Okay?"
    What we were before? Even more unsure and uncertain of each other was we are now? What's that supposed to mean?
    Before I can ask she walks to the front of the room to go over the schedule for tomorrow at the festival.
    I should probably pay to this, as I've never been to the school festival before and I don't know what to expect, but it's hard to focus. There are excited whispers all around me, and then at the thirty second mark, an elbow in my side.
    NATSUMI: "Earth to Takeru. Earth to Takeru."
    TAKERU: "You don't have to say it right in my ear."
    NATSUMI: "Nothing else seemed to be getting through to you."
    TAKERU: "Take a hint."
    NATSUMI: "Oh stop fooling around. You know I'm fantastic."
    TAKERU: "Not the first word I'd come up with to describe you. What do you want?"
    NATSUMI: "What was that all about, with you and Meiko, about last night, and too much, and all the shy faces, and the - "
    TAKERU: "Don't be stupid."
    NATSUMI: "Fiine. Alright. Next question, a related question... What are your plans for tomorrow?"
    TAKERU: "For the festival?"
    NATSUMI: "Well obviously. You wouldn't dare make other plans on the day of the Mirako school festival."
    TAKERU: "I was thinking I'd come."
    NATSUMI: "Yeah, but what booths are you going to? Got any clubs you're going to check out? Stuff to see? And who with? Who's it gonna be? Who're you watching the fireworks with? Give me three guesses."
    TAKERU: "There aren't any fireworks this year, at least not yet. I'll probably be forced to work with Kenta all day."
    NATSUMI: "Kenta? Really? You'd watch the fireworks with him? I didn't know that was your thing Takeru. I mean he's plenty handsome and I knew you guys were roommates but I didn't think it was something of that nature, like, you need to tell me about these things if - "
    TAKERU: "Stop wiggling your eyebrows like that. I mean he's counting on me for something or other so I'll probably do whatever he wants and stay quiet. I'm not really a 'festival' sort of person."
    NATSUMI: "Sure you are. And I've got a proposal. If you agree I'll leave you alone all day today."
    TAKERU: "You're planning something, then."
    NATSUMI: "Oh it's not much. But Hiyama's in his last year so he's in charge of the fundraiser this year even though I'm the captain, so I've got some wiggle room. And Meiko's not doing anything, so..."
    MEIKO: "Hm?"
    She's returned to her seat.
    MEIKO: "Oh heya Meiko. Takeru agreed he's hanging out with us tomorrow at the festival. Just us three."
    TAKERU: "I told you, Kenta wanted me to - "
    NATSUMI: "Sure, bring your weird roommate along. That guy's great."
    TAKERU: "I'm sure Meiko's busy."
    MEIKO: "I need to speak in the evening. But apart from that, if I've done my job right..."
    NATSUMI: "Meiko, you were just complaining to me earlier that you wouldn't know what to do with yourself. Stick with me and Takeru. We'll have a good time."
    MEIKO: "Alright. I'll do it."
    TAKERU: "Even if you rope Kenta into this, I have a few friend in this club, the uh..."
    MEIKO: "Supernatural club?"
    TAKERU: "Er, yes that. Hagami's performing on piano. It's got nothing to do with the supernatural so you can pick your jaw back up off the floor, Natsumi."
    NATSUMI: "The supernatural club? We've got one of those? You're a member? That quiet girl Natsumi in the back is a member?"
    TAKERU: "Long story, and I'm not explaining it. But I'm watching her perform. That's final."
    NATSUMI: "Okay, cool, we'll work around it. Meiko and Kenta and I will all come too. This'll be great. Swell. Fantastic. Maybe - "
    She's cut off by a glaring Meiko. Kunida's lecture has started.
    ...Not that any of the rest of the class cares. Everyone's too busy whispering about the festival, whether the fireworks will appear or not, who's going with whom, and so on...
    For the second time this morning I'm elbowed in the ribs.
    TAKERU: "Ow. Natsumi if you keep that up you'll bruise my kidneys."
    MEIKO: "Don't look so angry. You know I'm doing you a favor."
    TAKERU: "By getting my attention? Are you trying to tell me to focus on math class?"
    MEIKO: "No, nobody cares about that. I mean... The Legend."
    TAKERU: "Legend?"
    Does this have anything to do with Hikari?
    NATSUMI: "If you see the fireworks reflected in the eyes of your beloved... It's bound to last forever."
    TAKERU: "..."
    TAKERU: "Stop staring at me."
    NATSUMI: "Ha! You looked away first."
    TAKERU: "Stop joking around. There aren't any fireworks this year anyway."
    NATSUMI: "You say that, but..."
    NATSUMI: "What's up with that again, Meiko?"
    MEIKO: "Hm?"
    NATSUMI: "I'm just kidding. Come on, What's with everyone today? The festival's tomorrow. You guys are supposed to be excited! Humor me a little, would you?"
    NATSUMI: "Takeru you look like you're moping around in an existential crisis. Or maybe you've got a bad stomach bug. Can't tell."
    TAKERU: "I thought you said that once I promised I was coming tomorrow, you'd quiet down."
    NATSUMI: "I thought I did! Alright, but you'd both better be looking more cheerful."
    I was looking forward to the festival, at least before I knew there was so much riding on it. I need to talk to Meiko. Everything is moving downhill, toward the fireworks showtime at sunset tomorrow, and my time is running out.
    
    When the final class of the day is over, there's an audible cheer.
    No one heads home. Homeroom is still buzzing with students making plans, heading for their clubs, and there's even one group rehearsing a skit or play or something like that in the corner.
    Me, though... I sit here. Maybe ten minutes go by. I'm trying to think: how should I approach Meiko? What's the strategy? What's the plan?
    I'm asking myself that for the thousandth time when -
    MEIKO: "Hey."
    TAKERU: "Meiko?"
    MEIKO: "Were you doing anything for lunch?"
    TAKERU: "Er..."
    MEIKO: "That's alright. I shouldn't have interrupted you while you were concentrating. I'll see you tomorrow when - "
    TAKERU: "No, I was zoning out, that's all. I'm not busy."
    MEIKO: "Ah."
    She looks relieved, almost a little red in the face.
    TAKERU: "Do you want to try the roof again?"
    MEIKO: "I think so."
    MEIKO: "And... Yesterday, you said you knew about a chess set. It was orange and green. Do you remember that?"
    TAKERU: "Yeah, I know where it is. I'll bring it."
    MEIKO: "We'll meet in a few minutes, then?"
    TAKERU: "Be right there."
    I head out the door, opposite a stream of students coming from up the hall, all carrying tables and chairs and banners and signs and I have to dodge to the right to avoid being run down by the traffic.
    This is a break, though. She's given me an in. Now all I have to do is capitalize.
    I follow the familiar path down to the old wing but my brain is all fuzz. Why can't I think straight?
    There are a million ways I could bring the fireworks up, but I know I only have one shot, so maybe that's why my heart seems to be in my throat.
    But it's no problem to swing by the tea room at least, and pick up the hand-carved chess set that Hikari and I have used for the past few months since I came to Mirako. I can't imagine why Meiko wants it. But at least it's where I remember it, square on the table, and not stolen by Mana or hidden in the library or somewhere stupid.
    I dip into the room, grab it, then do a double take.
    TAKERU: "Hikari?"
    But there's no one there. A breeze from the midday air blows back the curtains, but I'm distinctly alone. There's no one seated in that chair opposite me.
    I tuck the folding board under my arm, head up the stairs past the old library --
    And almost straight into Mana. 
    TAKERU: "Hey! Watch where you're going."
    MANA: "You're the one running up and down the staircase when you should be in the meeting."
    TAKERU: "Meeting? What meeting?"
    MANA: "The Supernatural Club meeting! You're a founding member!"
    TAKERU: "Sorry, I'm a bit busy. I need to run this back to Meiko, and - "
    MANA: "But we've got a booth to run! A festival to plan! This is the day we're supposed to all spend together as a club!"
    TAKERU: "Is that really what we're supposed to do? Are you... You're not scheduling me in to run the club table are you?"
    MANA: "Well we were, until you didn't show up!"
    TAKERU: "I didn't know there was a meeting!"
    MANA: "Right! Exactly! That's why I'm here! Let's go!"
    TAKERU: "Look, Mana, I'm sorry, but I might have other, uh, commitments..."
    MEIKO: "Takeru?"
    This is the absolute worst timing for her to show up.
    MANA: "You! You're the commitment?"
    MEIKO: "I'm sorry?"
    MANA: "Aren't you one of Takeru's weird friends? The one that wanted to shut our club down?"
    MEIKO: "I'm sorry if we haven't met. I'm Kotaru Meiko. I'm a classmate of Takeru and I represent our class for - "
    MANA: "You tried to shut down our club."
    TAKERU: "And she also sign off on the application to bring it back."
    MANA: "..."
    The two stare at each other. And as much as Mana is trying to scrunch up her fists and look angry, it's fading away.
    She finally looks back to me.
    MANA: "But you'll come to the meeting, won't you?"
