When I wake up, beyond the window it's still black.
I can see out over the river, placid, black.
It's so late I'm not sure whether this hour belongs to today or yesterday or some other system of time altogether.
All I know is that the river is completely still.
I'm walking the route to Mirako. The silent road through town. The bend around the corner cafe.
The bridge comes into sight, spanning to the forested hill opposite, where Mirako stands on the slope.
There are no streetlights. It's hard to tell if it's really the moon lighting up the night because the sky is one complete shroud of mist, with light filtered through the clouds, and reflecting off the surface of the water.
Perfectly still water.
Someone's watching me.
At first I think they must be at the end of the bridge but there's no one there.
I'm acutely aware of every breath I take, every hair on the back of my arms, of a deep suspicion that nothing but me is moving.
There is movement, somewhere, though. The water flickers. Like it's reflecting a fire.
But I can't trace whatever causes those lights and now that I look again they're gone.
No, the source, the watcher, is downriver, half hidden by trees, in a black ruin standing on the riverside.
There's the light. No, two yellow points. Watching me.
