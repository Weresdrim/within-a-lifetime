Intermezzo planning - the "low point"
    Kenta
        Told him to gtfo and stop talking
        He responds by dividing the room in two
        At first it's nice but gets old fast
        Reconcile, still have the coin
    Meiko
        Eat lunch, she's vulnerable
        All of her "life points" are around other stuff
        Gives Takeru the club closure notice
        She's clearly running ragged
        Later demand from her to work on stuff again
    Hikari
        Meet every day, she's the only friend
        Everyone else stops noticing her physical self, has the chills
        She reads the book borrowed from Hagami
        Advises Takeru on how to fix all the broken garbage??
    Hagami
        Accused her of being Hikari
        Flees from Takeru
        Return her book and the signup sheet with one signature missing
        Begin the ghost research arc
        Late night go over the past
    Natsumi
        Warm welcome back, but...
        ...immediately tries to recruit, thinking illness originally prevented
        Cool after that
        Spat with Meiko over fireworks, leading further Meiko isolation
    Mana
        Show up at the club door but can't face Hagami
        Constantly nagging at Takeru to come back, in denial
        Serve her the papers
        Heartbroken
