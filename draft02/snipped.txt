    TAKERU: "About what happened to you... You are serious, aren't you?"
    HIKARI: "When am I ever not serious?"
    TAKERU: "Then, er..."
    TAKERU: "Maybe I don't see the whole picture. Could you tell me the truth about what happened to you at Mirako?"
    Silence.
    TAKERU: "Sorry. Meiko said it was suicide. I shouldn't - "
    HIKARI: "I never killed myself. I'm too much of a coward for that. How everyone thought I'd committed suicide is baffling to me. I would never."
    TAKERU: "That's just what Meiko told me. Was she lying...?"
    HIKARI: "Oh it's possible they all figured it was suicide, after the way I was acting. And if I'm honest I was probably depressed, but she should know better."
    TAKERU: "Meiko, you mean?"
    HIKARI: "Yes. Her."
    TAKERU: "Where does she fit into all this? She's been acting strange. The night I was at the boathouse she completely blew up at me over you."
    TAKERU: "I'm back at square one. I have no idea what actually happened to you at Mirako."
    Hikari sighs, and for a moment it looks like she's wilting.
    HIKARI: "I don't really like talking about it. I was a stupid, spoiled child. I embarassed myself and died a pointless death, and now everyone rightfully does their best to pretend I didn't exist."
    TAKERU: "I'd still like to know."
    HIKARI: "If you really do... Then I owe it to you to explain myself."
    HIKARI: "Remember I did warn you it isn't interesting."
    
    I was expecting to see the festival, this time last year. Isn't that when everything happened?
    But this...
    At first I don't know where I am. The view... The valley... Oh. The roof of Mirako.
    This might be the exact year to the day I was up here last week. The wind, the weather is right.
    There's someone standing against the side of the stairwell - I jump. But she's not looking at me, she's focused on something back inside Mirako.
    TAKERU: "Hikari?"
    HIKARI: "Oh!"
    She's more startled than I was.
    HIKARI: "I didn't know you were out there."
    HIKARI: "Have you seen Meiko?"
    TAKERU: "No?"
    And she turns around keep watch down the stairs again.
    I wander back inside, but I wonder what I'm supposed to be doing here. I'm sleepy and out place, like I've overslept by hours and hours. Maybe I imagined all that with the ghost hunt, Meiko flipping out, those terrible couple days, the hospital, Hikari...
    Then Meiko walks by, ignoring me completely.
    TAKERU: "Hey!"
    And by completely, I mean completely. She doesn't even glance back at me.
    Did I really offend her that much by visiting the old boathouse?
    Or is this...
    TAKERU: "I'm just a pair of eyes."
    TAKERU: "Fine. You can ignore me if you want, but I'm following you."
    TAKERU: "You got that?"
    No response.
    Meiko climbs the stairs without so much as even faltering.
    TAKERU: "You can ignore me. That's fine. I can understand that. I'll - "
    She vanishes up the stairwell.
    Oh well.
    I can't decide. Can she not see me? Does she choose not to see me? Just how much did I tick her off these past few days?
    Back before I was hospitalized again, before my break... I would've probably said she was an anchor for me. Someone that I could count on to always remain her good, reliable, self, no matter what.
    And now I hesitate.
    Could she really not see me?
    I follow to the roof.
    
    
    
    
    TAKERU: "Hang on, I've got a plan."
    This plan relies almost entirely on my being a bit taller, a bit more manly, a bit more manly, and a bit more "traditional kid" than Meiko.
    ...which is ridiculous considered how much of a obvious failure I am compared to her, but maybe it'll be enough to foil whatever old geezer is holed up in this shrine.
    MEIKO: "A plan?"
    TAKERU: "I'll go in first."
    ...
    It's a stupid, plan, really.

    Meiko walks behind me.
    Trying not to give her any attention, I walk to the nearest bulding. Even if I have no idea what I'm doing, maybe if I walk with my head high enough, with my hands behind my back, bluffing as I must know how...
    Maybe these backwards paperpushers and biased townspeople would be more inclined to listen to someone like me, than to someone like Meiko, strange as it seems.
    Especially if Meiko is about twice as smart as me and three times as good as presenting herself.
    But I have to do something, right?
    
    
    
    
    TAKERU: "Er... Hello."
    SECRETARY: "Yes, hello."
    SECRETARY: "How may I help you?"
    TAKERU: "Um, er, hello."
    
    TAKERU: "I'm from the um, er..."
    MEIKO: "You're from the student council."
    TAKERU: "Yes hello, my name is Takeru Ichiro."
    TAKERU: "I'm president of the Mirako School student council and I've been authorized to negotiate with you on behalf of my executive vice president, Kotaru Meiko."
    SECRETARY: "You're from the Mirako school?"
    TAKERU: "The Mirako school is the most important source of out-of-town culture for Shizukawa."
    TAKERU: "Isn't it?"
    SECRECTARY: "I'm not sure what you mean?"
    MEIKO: "Hint that..."
    TAKERU: "Of course the Mirako school..."
    TAKERU "Hang on, hint what?"
    SECRETARY: "Hang what?"
    MEKIO: "Hang... I mean..."
    MEIKO: "This is the single most important time of the year."
    
    
    
    
    TAKERU: "Don't feel like you have to pity me or anything."
    HIKARI: "You should tell me what's up. Whatever is happening at Mirako, you should let me know. Did you not hear that?"
    TAKERU: "I don't exactly lead the most interesting life around here."
    HIKARI: "That's what makes it interesting to me."
    HIKARI: "It... Sometimes it's hard for me to really understand what's going on with all of you in Mirako second year. Most of the time I want to give up trying to work it all out."
    HIKARI: "But sometimes I can relate to you, as a new student, and it makes me still interested in all the small gossip and drama you all go through. As a high school girl, it's healthy for that to be the sort of thing I'm into, isn't it?"
    TAKERU: "Hell if I know..."
    HIKARI: "Then I'm deciding that it's healthy. Queen, A2."
    TAKERU: "Hang on, wait, if you move your queen then that means that I..."
    TAKERU: "I'm taking that move back as well."
    HIKARI: "Too late. If you want to stay out of checkmate, then you're explaining to me what's going on between you and Hagami."
    
    
    
    KUNIDA: "Ahem. Excuse me. The votes are all tallied and I'm happy to announce that your class representative for this year will be Kotaru Meiko. Please congratulate her and the rest of the candidates."
    There's some scattered applause, but Meiko has a blank look as she stands. Weird. It's Meiko, of course she would be expecting to win an election for class rep, so why does she look so surprised? Is that... not the strangest thing here?
    But with only a flicker she reverts to the Meiko I know - collected, friendly.
    MEIKO: "Hey everyone."
    MEIKO: "Thanks for supporting me, and I'll be sure to support you as well. I know you all must be as stressed as I am starting at a new high school, for most of us far away from home."
    MEIKO: "So don't hesitate to come to me if you need advice or a an ear or a shoulder. I'll try to become someone you can rely on. So thanks again, everyone."
    She bows, to more applause. Kunida says something or other, but I'm not really paying attention. Meiko is headed my way. I feel like I should say something, but Natsumi intercepts her.





When I wake up, beyond the window it's still black.
I can see out over the river, placid, black.
It's so late I'm not sure whether this hour belongs to today or yesterday or some other system of time altogether.
All I know is that the river is completely still.
I'm walking the route to Mirako. The silent road through town. The bend around the corner cafe.
The bridge comes into sight, spanning to the forested hill opposite, where Mirako stands on the slope.
There are no streetlights. It's hard to tell if it's really the moon lighting up the night because the sky is one complete shroud of mist, with light filtered through the clouds, and reflecting off the surface of the water.
Perfectly still water.
Someone's watching me.
At first I think they must be at the end of the bridge but there's no one there.
I'm acutely aware of every breath I take, every hair on the back of my arms, of a deep suspicion that nothing but me is moving.
There is movement, somewhere, though. The water flickers. Like it's reflecting a fire.
But I can't trace whatever causes those lights and now that I look again they're gone.
No, the source, the watcher, is downriver, half hidden by trees, in a black ruin standing on the riverside.
There's the light. No, two yellow points. Watching me.
