    TAKERU: "Hang on, I've got a plan."
    This plan relies almost entirely on my being a bit taller, a bit more manly, a bit more manly, and a bit more "traditional kid" than Meiko.
    ...which is ridiculous considered how much of a obvious failure I am compared to her, but maybe it'll be enough to foil whatever old geezer is holed up in this shrine.
    MEIKO: "A plan?"
    TAKERU: "I'll go in first."
    ...
    It's a stupid, plan, really.

    Meiko walks behind me.
    Trying not to give her any attention, I walk to the nearest bulding. Even if I have no idea what I'm doing, maybe if I walk with my head high enough, with my hands behind my back, bluffing as I must know how...
    Maybe these backwards paperpushers and biased townspeople would be more inclined to listen to someone like me, than to someone like Meiko, strange as it seems.
    Especially if Meiko is about twice as smart as me and three times as good as presenting herself.
    But I have to do something, right?
    
    
    
    
    TAKERU: "Er... Hello."
    SECRETARY: "Yes, hello."
    SECRETARY: "How may I help you?"
    TAKERU: "Um, er, hello."
    
    TAKERU: "I'm from the um, er..."
    MEIKO: "You're from the student council."
    TAKERU: "Yes hello, my name is Takeru Ichiro."
    TAKERU: "I'm president of the Mirako School student council and I've been authorized to negotiate with you on behalf of my executive vice president, Kotaru Meiko."
    SECRETARY: "You're from the Mirako school?"
    TAKERU: "The Mirako school is the most important source of out-of-town culture for Shizukawa."
    TAKERU: "Isn't it?"
    SECRECTARY: "I'm not sure what you mean?"
    MEIKO: "Hint that..."
    TAKERU: "Of course the Mirako school..."
    TAKERU "Hang on, hint what?"
    SECRETARY: "Hang what?"
    MEKIO: "Hang... I mean..."
    MEIKO: "This is the single most important time of the year."
    
    
    
    
    TAKERU: "Don't feel like you have to pity me or anything."
    HIKARI: "You should tell me what's up. Whatever is happening at Mirako, you should let me know. Did you not hear that?"
    TAKERU: "I don't exactly lead the most interesting life around here."
    HIKARI: "That's what makes it interesting to me."
    HIKARI: "It... Sometimes it's hard for me to really understand what's going on with all of you in Mirako second year. Most of the time I want to give up trying to work it all out."
    HIKARI: "But sometimes I can relate to you, as a new student, and it makes me still interested in all the small gossip and drama you all go through. As a high school girl, it's healthy for that to be the sort of thing I'm into, isn't it?"
    TAKERU: "Hell if I know..."
    HIKARI: "Then I'm deciding that it's healthy. Queen, A2."
    TAKERU: "Hang on, wait, if you move your queen then that means that I..."
    TAKERU: "I'm taking that move back as well."
    HIKARI: "Too late. If you want to stay out of checkmate, then you're explaining to me what's going on between you and Hagami."
    
    
    
    KUNIDA: "Ahem. Excuse me. The votes are all tallied and I'm happy to announce that your class representative for this year will be Kotaru Meiko. Please congratulate her and the rest of the candidates."
    There's some scattered applause, but Meiko has a blank look as she stands. Weird. It's Meiko, of course she would be expecting to win an election for class rep, so why does she look so surprised? Is that... not the strangest thing here?
    But with only a flicker she reverts to the Meiko I know - collected, friendly.
    MEIKO: "Hey everyone."
    MEIKO: "Thanks for supporting me, and I'll be sure to support you as well. I know you all must be as stressed as I am starting at a new high school, for most of us far away from home."
    MEIKO: "So don't hesitate to come to me if you need advice or a an ear or a shoulder. I'll try to become someone you can rely on. So thanks again, everyone."
    She bows, to more applause. Kunida says something or other, but I'm not really paying attention. Meiko is headed my way. I feel like I should say something, but Natsumi intercepts her.




    MANA: "Should we try the Mirako basements again? You hardly even came last time."
    HAGAMI: "Hm... I thought maybe..."
    HAGAMI: "Do you know that old building on the river? The ruin?"
    MANA: "The um, old boathouse?"
    HAGAMI: "You can sort of see it from the bridge. It looks like maybe it burned at one point."
    MANA: "Yeah, it burned, but um..."
    MANA: "Wow... Are you sure? There are rumors that that place is... haunted."
    HAGAMI: "That's... the point?"
    TAKERU: "As long as it's not going to fall into the water soon as anyone steps in there, fine by me."
    My guess is we'd end up just poking around the outside of the place anyway.
    While we're talking about this... I know Hagami will probably think less of me but I have to ask -
    TAKERU: "So can I get a straight answer about what actually happened over there?"
    MANA: "Um, I guess it burned down around this time last year, at the festival."
    TAKERU: "Wait, during the Mirako school open house thing?"
    MANA: "Yeah. That's the only school festival we've got."
    MANA: "It was a whole thing last year. Something happened with the fireworks and, I don't know, the old boathouse caught fire."
    TAKERU: "Is that what that is? A boathouse?"
    MANA: "Yeah. My uncle said Mirako owns it, but it's not like we've had a rowing team for years and years. It was part of the original land donation to found the school. But that was way back."
    TAKERU: "Your uncle... So Mr. Kunida knows about it."
    TAKERU: "Meiko was saying they cancelled the fireworks this year anyway."
    MANA: "Really? That sucks... But I guess it makes sense."
    TAKERU: "Yeah, I guess, if there was an accident."
    TAKERU: "Then again..."
    Who actually cancelled the fireworks?
    Last week... it's fuzzy, but wasn't it Mr. Kunida asking Meiko if she was sure about calling off the fireworks? Why would she be involved? Wouldn't the teachers just cancel things and be done with it?
    MANA: "No fireworks... No Seiji first edition... Maybe this festival we'll just have to spend recruiting to Mirako's premier ghost hunter society!"
    HAGAMI: "Then... you're coming?"
    MANA: "Coming to the first ghost hunt organized by Master Hagami? For sure!"
    MANA: "You could've chosen someplace less haunted to start with but I wouldn't miss it for the world!"
