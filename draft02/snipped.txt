    TAKERU: "Hang on, I've got a plan."
    This plan relies almost entirely on my being a bit taller, a bit more manly, a bit more manly, and a bit more "traditional kid" than Meiko.
    ...which is ridiculous considered how much of a obvious failure I am compared to her, but maybe it'll be enough to foil whatever old geezer is holed up in this shrine.
    MEIKO: "A plan?"
    TAKERU: "I'll go in first."
    ...
    It's a stupid, plan, really.

    Meiko walks behind me.
    Trying not to give her any attention, I walk to the nearest bulding. Even if I have no idea what I'm doing, maybe if I walk with my head high enough, with my hands behind my back, bluffing as I must know how...
    Maybe these backwards paperpushers and biased townspeople would be more inclined to listen to someone like me, than to someone like Meiko, strange as it seems.
    Especially if Meiko is about twice as smart as me and three times as good as presenting herself.
    But I have to do something, right?
    
    
    
    
    TAKERU: "Er... Hello."
    SECRETARY: "Yes, hello."
    SECRETARY: "How may I help you?"
    TAKERU: "Um, er, hello."
    
    TAKERU: "I'm from the um, er..."
    MEIKO: "You're from the student council."
    TAKERU: "Yes hello, my name is Takeru Ichiro."
    TAKERU: "I'm president of the Mirako School student council and I've been authorized to negotiate with you on behalf of my executive vice president, Kotaru Meiko."
    SECRETARY: "You're from the Mirako school?"
    TAKERU: "The Mirako school is the most important source of out-of-town culture for Shizukawa."
    TAKERU: "Isn't it?"
    SECRECTARY: "I'm not sure what you mean?"
    MEIKO: "Hint that..."
    TAKERU: "Of course the Mirako school..."
    TAKERU "Hang on, hint what?"
    SECRETARY: "Hang what?"
    MEKIO: "Hang... I mean..."
    MEIKO: "This is the single most important time of the year."
    
    
    
    
    TAKERU: "Don't feel like you have to pity me or anything."
    HIKARI: "You should tell me what's up. Whatever is happening at Mirako, you should let me know. Did you not hear that?"
    TAKERU: "I don't exactly lead the most interesting life around here."
    HIKARI: "That's what makes it interesting to me."
    HIKARI: "It... Sometimes it's hard for me to really understand what's going on with all of you in Mirako second year. Most of the time I want to give up trying to work it all out."
    HIKARI: "But sometimes I can relate to you, as a new student, and it makes me still interested in all the small gossip and drama you all go through. As a high school girl, it's healthy for that to be the sort of thing I'm into, isn't it?"
    TAKERU: "Hell if I know..."
    HIKARI: "Then I'm deciding that it's healthy. Queen, A2."
    TAKERU: "Hang on, wait, if you move your queen then that means that I..."
    TAKERU: "I'm taking that move back as well."
    HIKARI: "Too late. If you want to stay out of checkmate, then you're explaining to me what's going on between you and Hagami."
