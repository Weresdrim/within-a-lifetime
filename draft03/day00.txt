label day00:

    I ran.
    Beyond the school, beyond the field, beyond the reach of the shouting voices that echoed behind me in confusion and fear --
    I ran because that vague idea of "someone" was chasing, the people that had kept me chained in the Mirako school for these three months and who I expected to at any moment grab my shoulders, throw me to the ground, and beat and kick and thrash me.
    So I ran and ran and ran out of the field, down the trail, through the woods, to the river, and finally there I stopped.
    TAKERU: "Ha... Ha..."
    My breathing was harsh but I knew I had more in me. The real problem was the pounding in my heart (in my head?) moving THUMP THUMP THUMP almost threatening to overtake the crash and roar of the river before me.
    The Shizukawa... Ironic name. The river is loud, even in clear weather. The entire thing gurgles and coughs water droplets feet into the air.
    I can't remember if it's been stormy the past few days (I want to say thunderstorms, it has to be thunderstorms) but, regardless, the damn river is loud and loud enough to camoflauge my torn breathing.
    So I cross to the middle of the river to admire the scenery.
    This is the old railway bridge. The newer auto and pedestrian bridges is further back down the road, but all the students at the Mirako dorm take the shortcut, even though the rail bridge hasn't been used in thirty years and the only thing between the students and the fifty foot drop into the Shizukawa is a single-post wood railing.
    That's the railing I'm sitting on right now, facing downriver. All the chaos of Mirako, the Mirako festival, my pursuers, my persecuters... That's all behind me. The only thing in front of me is THAT, the giant smoking flaming shell hanging over the river.
    TAKERU: "It's kind of beautiful from here."
    It can't be more than half a mile downriver, but now that old building is breathing its last, the popping of wood and the hissing of cinders audible all the way from here as it slowly sinks down the riverbank.
    Of course... I'm the reason it all ended up this way.
    TAKERU: "...Ha."
    And so I sit. With the chaos of my old life behind me (chaos: muffled screams, maybe a siren, a hundred panicked voices, the rush of a stampede) and before, me... A ruin to be. Ruins. The river a surge of noise below, the building a tower of flame above.
    
    I've caught my breath but my eyes never leave the flames downriver. But I don't need my eyes to tell there's someone coming down the path. It make sense -- probably some student from my dorm running home after this disaster at the festival.
    I wonder if they'll even notice me here on the railing. But the footsteps stop. Directly behind me. I don't need to turn my head.
    TAKERU: "So you're here."
    ????: "Wh - "
    Of course it's her. Who else would run this far, that hard? The first of my pursuers. And still I stare straight ahead.
    TAKERU: "Hey, Meiko."
    MEIKO: "Takeru! It is you. You, you - "
    Two impacts. First my right side, then my left. Her hands are on my shoulders.
    TAKERU: "What're you going to do? Push me in?"
    MEIKO: "I'll do it. Don't think I won't. I don't know if you'd die right away from this far up, but... You wouldn't be the first to drown in the Shizukawa."
    TAKERU: "Meiko..."
    Even with her hands on my shoulders, she's standing almost at my side. When I turn to face her, I watch her eyebrows, the corner of her mouth, and the way the flames are reflected in her watery eyes with each blink. It's obvious.
    TAKERU: "You're lying. You won't push me and you never could."
    It's almost too boring.
    MEIKO: "Takeru! Why?"
    What she wants me to do is turn around. And so I do, and Meiko switches her grip, her right arm on my left shoulder, face to face. Behind me, can she see it burning?"
    MEIKO: "You've won. I give up. I just have to know..."
    MEIKO: "What was it I did that made you hate me so much? You've won already! Just tell me!"
    Her eyes flicker back and forth. An honest question.
    TAKERU: "I didn't win."
    TAKERU: "You and your people chased me all the way out here. I'm sure everything thinks I'm crazy now. There's definitely no way I can go back to the Mirako school. Probably they'd put me straight in an institution."
    TAKERU: "It's probably... Stalemate. A tie. Doesn't that work?"
    MEIKO: "Takeru! You need to tell me. If you just hadn't... Why did you jump on stage at the festival and say all that? Why'd you have to do it? Do you really hate me that much?"
    MEIKO: "And if you don't think I won't push you off this bridge, right here... You don't know know anything about me. Not anything! Not the first thing!"
    But Meiko slips forward. She doesn't have my a grip on me anymore, just her arms around my shoulders, her face an inch from mine.
    Just a breath between her face and mine.
    And it's more clear to me than ever, in those watery eyes of hers, she doesn't have it in her, and I could taunt her from the side of this bridge for a million years and she'd run away into the night a million times before I wound up in the water.
    And even though it's that clear to me in this space between her eyes and mine, for some reason it's me that looks away.
    And Meiko lets go and runs off towards the dorms without as much as a glance back.
    TAKERU: "Stalemate."
    I'm not sure why it seems such a funny word. There are more people passing by me on the bridge now, ignoring me hunched on the railing as I watch over them. Can they see me? I wonder. They're only black shadows. I know behind me as the flames billow off that burning wreck my silhouette must be pure black in the firelight, as they panic past me, ignoring me.
    There are no pursuers any more. If Meiko gave up... They're gone. I should be invisible.
    
    Which is why it surprises me when a male student I know stops beside me.
    KENTA: "Hey."
    TAKERU: "Oh. It's Kenta. What can I do for you?"
    KENTA: "If you sit there you'll fall."
    TAKERU: "I'll be fine."
    KENTA: "You'll fall."
    KENTA: "I assume you don't want to fall. Because that would be illogical. Why would anyone want to die?"
    TAKERU: "Beats me."
    And he keeps walking, with the rest of them.
    My roommate, Kenta. It's always been easy to lie to him because there isn't a bone in his body tuned for mistrust.
    Why would anyone want to die? Kenta was never wired for it. He could never understand. But I will always understand as I sit here with my back to the Shizukawa, a wreathing spiral of fire at my back, downriver, watching the shadows of my pursuers hurry past me down the rail bridge.
    
    I thought the footsteps hurrying past had died down. But there's another set that I was expected, a pair of footfalls, two people hurrying by who suddenly stop in the darkness.
    Her.
    HAGAMI: "..."
    And her.
    MANA: "Takeru you rat bastard! You donkey's ass! You, you, you...!"
    MANA: "The festival's ruined! I knew you were a dick and bastard and an asshole and a..."
    But Mana doesn't come any closer. She's afraid. She can sit there and shout, with that other girl's hand in hers, but it doesn't stop how scared she is. Fear is the hardest emotion to hide.
    MANA: "You crow's butt! You lizard's leg! You snake's eye! You - "
    There's some distance in time where she keeps swearing at me, and the structure behind me keeps smoking, and her lungs grow tired, and I lose interest in staring at her, that... she moves on. This is stalemate, maybe. But the burden is too much for some. The weak are used to defeat, and so they see these ties as another defeat, and they run. And Mana runs.
    And so there is only person left behind.
    HAGAMI: "..."
    TAKERU: "If you don't have anything to say... Then keep moving. Go back to the dorms. There's nothing here for you."
    HAGAMI: "I.."
    One of the silhoettes passes in front of her.
    The another, and another.
    Her shadow is barely visible behind the crowd. I know she's not looking at me -- instead Hagami stares at the ground.
    It feels like that instant was fleeting, when it was midnight and I felt I had duelled the forces that opposed me to a draw. If it were truly a tie, then I wouldn't still be sitting here unseen to my pursuers, opposed only by this girl who was so weak she couldn't even meet my eyes.
    What's wrong, Hagami? Afraid of what I might see in you?
    And so she opened her eyes, on the opposite side of the bridge, long after the other shadows left. But Hagami said nothing and instead fled with just a sob.
    And I was left here, facing away from the burning building down the river, wondering just what I'd done to offend Hagami, the one girl who was so oblivious I swear it was easier to fool her than my roommate Kenta. What clued her off? What made her run off?
    Oh.
    Of course.
    
    The answer is right beside me.
    The "answer," that girl... She's facing the inferno that blazes half a mile down the Shizukawa, while she herself is perched on the rail beside me.
    TAKERU: "'Evening."
    HIKARI: "Good evening to you too, Takeru. I'm surprised you noticed me."
    TAKERU: "You showed up at just the right time."
    There's no one here by now.
    It's well past midnight.
    The sirens are gone, the panic is gone, the footsteps are gone, the fire is gone... All that's left before me is a ruin, smoking in the midsummer's night, the last witness to a world only visible to me and Her.
    Me and Her. HIKARI.
    HIKARI: "You didn't have to go all this way."
    TAKERU: "If I half-assed it no one would've believed me. This is Mirako we're talking about. Everyone at this school is delusional by definition."
    HIKARI: "But... If you'd ignored me... You could've led a normal school life. You could've just been Takeru, the ordinary transfer student. Wouldn't that be better, to be a loveable goofball that no one took seriously than... this?"
    TAKERU: "Stop joking around, Hikari. I could never be a loveable anything."
    HIKARI: "True."
    HIKARI: "You're like me, in that sense, you know. You know?"
    I missed the exact moment, but she was sitting beside me, staring at the Shizukawa.
    We were us, the only two people on this planet, who could see what I now saw before me: a smoldering ruin, a wreck over the river now threating to sink wholeslae into the scattered waters.
    Hikari.
    The one person whose face I didn't need to read to know what she was thinking...
    The one person who sat beside me when every other traitor who'd claimed to be my friend ran away...
    The one soul in existence who I'm sure could feel me presence by their side, as I could feel theirs, on this worthless wooden rail that was the only thing keeping us on this side of that life-or-death boundary.
    I wondered.
    I wondered and wondered and wondered.
    TAKERU: "Isn't this stalemate?"
    HIKARI: "Stalemate?"
    She who said this, gazing off into the smoky horizon.
    TAKERU: "Nobody wins."
    TAKERU: "No one believes me. Probably after tonight, they all think I'm a lunatic. And you..."
    HIKARI: "Ahehe."
    TAKERU: "..?"
    HIKARI: "Ahaha ha... ha..."
    One second of silence as we gaze out over the river - 
    HIKARI: "Takeru."
    HIKARI: "If one year ago, you had been here..."
    TAKERU: "Hikari...!"
    It's too late for me to stop her, of course. She's too clever for that. She, who taught me half of what I know about this life, standing up there on the rail, just a profile in black and gray against that smoking thing -
    HIKARI: "A stalemate is a tie."
    HIKARI: "A tie is another word for a loss. We've lost this round. I'm not sure where it happened, but I did you wrong..."
    TAKERU: "You're not allowed to say things like that!"
    HIKARI: "It's fine. Isn't it!? Don't you see?"
    She points out to that smoke miles and miles downstream.
    HIKARI: "You see that, right?"
    TAKERU: "Of course I see it."
    HIKARI: "You really do?"
    TAKERU: "..."
    She sits next to me, eyes fixed on mine. The only person I've met in so long who can meet my gaze without balking, flinching, grimacing, or turning away like a coward.
    She searches for the truth in my eyes just as I search in hers. And Hikari is the person who brought me to this cliff. Without her, I would be nothing. So in her, I see an intense mistrust, a suspicion born out a lifetime of people misunderstanding her.
    And the guarded hope behind those eyes... She's the only person I've felt this whole night (lifetime?) that's truly beside me.
    And so we stand side by side, staring out, at the haze and the smoldering wreck on the riverside. Somewhere, down there, soon it will be dawn. But I don't want to see it.
    HIKARI: "Do you understand now?"
    TAKERU: "I do."
    HIKARI: "You'll come join me?"
    TAKERU: "I will."
    HIKARI: "Do you blame me?"
    TAKERU: "I can't. Ha, even if you weren't here I'd do this whole thing again."
    HIKARI: "Then what do you think of me?"
    HIKARI: "Takeru?"
    HIKARI: "What am I to you?"
    She says that with faraway eyes that should be right next to mine. But instead she's tumbling, head over heel over head straight into the roaring river below and it's only in retrospect that I realize --
    Hikari fell backwards.
    And I can never read those eyes, soaring away from mine, even in these last moments.
    She's a mystery. She'll always be a mystery, because, she's gone now. Forever.
    And in those few eternal moments where I can still see the afterimage of those pupils locked in mine on that cursed bridge over the Shizukawa, that's when I fully understand the girl I knew as Hikari, now plummeting towards the rapids --
    It's a hopelessness. But also a longing.
    It's an understanding that I share now too. That even the most lost of souls among us has at least one twin star out there in the infinite universe, and, that the one twin to mine is falling away, further than I can ever reach her.
    So when I myself bend over backwards, downwards -
    I hear her voice in my mind. Just some last reverberations of some last words.
    What am I to her? What am I? To anyone?
    Nothing, probably?
    TAKERU: "Absolutely nothing! Ahahaha!"
    So I can't help but laugh as I pitch off the rail and just keep laughing that absurdity in what must be my final half second.
    I am nothing, to no one. That's who I am. A failure that managed to stalemate with nobody.
    So it's a miracle why in that moment all those memories played out in front of me. So close that if I reached out and tried, I could change them.
    So in what should've been my last second... I saw something: things, places, times, people, that I'm sure I had seen before. And I'm sure if I had chosen differently, if I had known this was the end in store for me...
    Maybe I'd have chosen differently. There's this blank-eyed Takeru, tumbling over and over into the sure death of the Shizukawa, the throwaway chess piece, sacrificed, who meant nothing to nobody...
    But there is also a stranger I glimpsed beyond the veil, a "me" who...
    ...a me who something, something, was someting, did something, something I couldn't grasp, and it all fell away with a sound, a terrific, TERRIFIC terrifying last-second-of-my-life last-gasp-of-air last-hairsbreadth-instant -
    Then I remembered.
