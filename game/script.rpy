label day01:

    "It's the thousandth time I've woken up here with no purpose at all."
    "I've never been big on reading. I can't catch baseball games any more on the TV."
    "There's no one around my age."
    "It's not as if I'm imprisoned here, but, if that's so..."
    "...then why can't I leave?"
    "It's the thousandth time I've wondered whether there's anything outside worth going back to, and even if there was I wonder how I would ever know it."
    "If there's a purgatory, then this is it."
    
    doctor "Takeru."
    "My name brings me out of my trance."
    doctor "Sorry if I disturbed you, but it's time for our morning checkin."
    takeru "No, sorry, I wasn't doing anything important."
    "Doctor Meadow. He's the man in charge of my care here. A psychiatrist."
    doctor "Oh? You looked pretty deep in concentration."
    takeru "Just bored."
    doctor "Well, today I have some exciting news."
    takeru "News?"
    doctor "We're ready to discharge you. There's still some formalities to go and some decisions you need to make along with your parents and things like that, but we're confident that your diagnosis and treatment..."
    "He fades out of my perception. Discharged. Should I be excited? Instead I just feel a panic in my gut."
    "He mentioned my decision."
    doctor "Did you get all that?"
    takeru "Yes."
    doctor "You'll also be happy to know that means no more tests today. I'm sure you don't mind that, right?"
    takeru "No. Thanks."
    "He shoots me a confidential smirk."
    doctor "But between you and me I think you just put down whatever answers you liked on those tests anyway."
    takeru "..."
    doctor "I'll be back this afternoon after you'd had a chance to think things over and we'll get the forms started. Have a good day, Takeru."
    "He turns his back to me and I turn my attention back to the white-washed walls."
    
    "Maybe I had just put down whatever on Meadow's battery of tests, but it had got them a diagnosis anyway."
    "Schizophrenia."
    "It's a tough word for me. When I thought on it before, it was always a word for other people."
    "Me and my friends and teammates never had time to spare for anyone like that."
    "Maybe that's why none of them have ever come to visit me. Well, who would expect them to, considering the circumstances?"
    "My parents visit, but they never look me in the eye any more."
    "Maybe they also have some feelings on having a mental patient for a son."
    "Meadow said they'd get used to it. Personally I don't care about his opinion, or really about the opinion of my parents, either."
    "But in the month or so since I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, personally, I haven't been able to form an opinion either."
    "Maybe that's why the prospect of leaving makes me shiver, even though I detest this place."
    "A psych ward. If you'd told me a month ago this is where I'd end up, I'd laugh."
    "It wouldn't be a nice laugh."
    
    "Two cards lie on the plastic table in the center of the room."
    "The first is a form letter from Tohoku High School."
    "We're sorry to hear about your injury. Best wishes and here's to a full recovery. We know you'll be back on the field soon!"
    " - Your friends at Tohoku"
    "It's form letter garbage. Sports injuries are common at any athletics-focused high school, enough that they have this glossy letter from the office ready to go."
    "There's a picture of a sunset over the school baseball field on one side, and a smiling guy in a sling on the other."
    "Unfortunately breaking my brain isn't quite on the same scale as a broken arm."
    "I won't be back on the field any time soon. And that's the problem."
    "With the massive mess I made on the way out, no doubt everyone there will have a completely different perception of me."
    "Truth is, I've seen this form card from \"Your friends at Tohoku\" lying on hospital tables before."
    "But when I visited my classmates for torn rotators or other mundane injuries, it was always under a stack of letters of encouragement from real friends, just like the patient was always surrounded by friends."
    "No one's sent me anything and no one's come to visit. I know what it'll be like if I ever go back, so..."
    "I have a choice."
    "Can I really ever go back to Tohoku?"
    "I'll be reviled. Probably I've already lost my scholarship, so I won't be able to afford it, either."
    "I'll be useless there."
    "It feels like I've been hit in the gut. There's no going back."
    
    "I pick up the other card."
    "Welcome to Mirako High School - A Sanctuary from the World..."
    "There's a winding road pictured. That's right, it's in the countryside somewhere. I think up north."
    "Greenery lines the guardrail, and above on a hill, a school of glass and white walls."
    "I wonder if that was intentional. The polished look almost reminds me of the sterile interior of my current room, this holding cell where I'm confined."
    "Dear prospective student, we know you must have many questions before deciding to transfer to Mirako. As you discuss Mirako with your psychiatrist, here's some things to..."
    "But I've read this paragraph so many times I could recite it verbatim if Meadow asked me if I'd read it again."
    "Mirako High School isn't just a school for the locals of Mirako, but a school for mental patients as well."
    "Or, not mental patients per se, but people with mental illness? Psychiatric issues?"
    "I can't find a good term, even if I'm \"one of them\" now."
    "But bottom line: it's a new beginning. A new beginning where I'll have absolutely no foothold, no special talents, no friends or (thankfully) no ex-friends turned enemies."
    "The anxiety that's been hovering around me since Meadow left is starting to lift. I don't feel lethargic any more, just very very uneasy."
    "I put the card down. It seems I've come to a decision."
    "The Ichiro Takeru that attended the great Tohoku High School on a full scholarship is dead. I can't bring him back. I'm just too busy mourning him to move on."
    
    "Thump."
    "Thump thump."
    "Thump thump thump thump thump."
    "It's a splitting headache."
    "My first day back in my new life, and fate sees fit to give me a migraine..."
    "Thump thump."
    "I'm exhausted. I spent all night moving my things to this dorm."
    "Thump."
    "It's like someone's... knocking on my forehead?"
    "I open my eyes."
    takeru "Hey!"
    "If I hadn't just rollled out of the way, I'd have received another rap on the forehead from the guy standing over me."
    kenta "Wake up. You should've been up at 7:00."
    takeru "Quit it."
    "I land on the floor as I dodge him again."
    kenta "Wake up."
    takeru "Leave me alone already. If I fell off the bad then I'm awake, okay?"
    kenta "You sure don't look awake."
    "He's right. The room is unfamiliar, the light is blinding, and this guy is a total stranger."
    "Although..."
    takeru "Then you must be my roommate. Kenta, right?"
    kenta "Undou Kenta. Yes. You need to wake up."
    "I hold my face in my hands."
    takeru "Right, I'm Takeru, nice to meet you I guess."
    takeru "Do you always knock on peoples' heads in the morning?"
    kenta "You didn't set an alarm and you need to be awake for school. You shouldn't be late, especially on your first day."
    takeru "There are more gentle ways of waking people up, you know?"
    kenta "Sorry for waking you up then. But you need to wake up. It's past 7:00."
    "I swear I've lost five minutes of my morning by talking with this guy already."
    "Maybe it's just too early for me but the thread of this conversation seems to be turning into a vortex."
    takeru "Right..."
    
    "He wanders off, presumably to get ready for school, but he already has on the Mirako uniform."
    "I'm the one completely unprepared, sitting here half on half off the bed, scrunching my eyes against the light."
    "Who knows where this guy was last night when I was busy carting my bags into the dorm..."
    "Wait."
    "My bags."
    "Although I could've sworn I just dropped all my junk on the floor last night, I don't see any trace of my belongings."
    "The dorm isn't small, but the setup is spartan, with two desks, two dressers, two low beds, and an open doorway into the bathroom where Kenta stands combing the same strand of hair over and over again."
    "But that's it. Everything's organized at right angles like a drawn floorplan. Didn't I leave my suitcase on the dresser?"
    "Maybe in my exhaustion I actually put my things away properly."
    "With a great effort and a loud yawn I manage to extricate myself from the bed and stumble over to the dresser on my half of the room."
    "This would be at lot easier if my forehead weren't throbbing. I guess I've got Kenta to thank for that."
    "As I pull open the top drawer I hear a... jingle?"
    "There are no clothes in this drawer."
    "Only a few hundred coins, some labelled, some on stands, some loose in the belly of the drawer."
    "Am I dreaming? Or hell, I'm maybe the meds they gave me back at the ward aren't working right after all."
    "The next drawer opens: more coins."
    "With growing dread, I open the last drawer. Nope, my uniform's not here, just more damn coins."
    
    kenta "Hey, slow down! If you open the drawer that fast you'll knock everything down!"
    "My roommate is no more than six inches behind me."
    takeru "Ah! Kenta!"
    takeru "W-where's my stuff? Have you seen some suitcases around here? Or a duffle bag with my uniform and clothes in it? Or..."
    kenta "Oh, your things. It's all where it should be."
    takeru "Kenta, that stuff should be in my dresser. Or where I left it."
    kenta "My coin collection should be in your dresser. Clothing doesn't belong there."
    takeru "..."
    takeru "Your coin collection?"
    kenta "Yep! Coins are my passion. I'm really glad you like them too. I couldn't help but notice that you were looking at my collection. Maybe later we can - "
    takeru "Your coin collection is in my dresser."
    kenta "Well, see, before you came here, it was my coin dresser. I wouldn't want to change things all of a sudden, so..."
    takeru "Alright, look Kenta, we can go over your coins or whatever later. For now I just really need some clothes."
    "This is all a collosal mistake. I should be back at Tohoku right now, scorned by everyone but at least being able to dress myself in the morning."
    kenta "When I woke up your clothes were everywhere, so I helped you out. It wouldn't be good if you woke up on your first day and didn't know where any of your clothes were."
    takeru "Kenta I have no idea where my clothes are."
    kenta "Everything's right there."
    "He gestures at his dresser like it's the most obvious thing in the world."
    kenta "This drawer is for darks."
    "He tosses me a uniform top."
    kenta "This drawer is socks. You can see from the label, of course."
    "He tosses me my socks."
    takeru "These are mine, right?"
    kenta "I think so? My stuff's in here too but it shouldn't make much of a difference."
    kenta "Top floor is for uniforms, bottom is for weekends. I've sorted dark colors into the right half, but make sure when you do laundry you put socks in the middle drawer. I prefer my clothes to be ironed, but if - "
    takeru "Alright. Okay. I have clothes. Just let me take a shower, please."
    kenta "I usually shower at night. That means in the morning you have more time to - "
    kenta "Wait, the shampoo is arranged such that - "
    "I shut the bathroom door on him."
    
    "I have no idea what Kenta's deal is but I'm just going to try to do my best to find some sense of normalcy in this new place."
    "As I rush through my morning routine, I can't help but feel a bit of panic. Or maybe it's dread."
    "Is everyone I meet today going to be like Kenta?"
    "Or even worse, is everyone I meet today going to be like me?"
    "I splash water from the sink on my face."
    "The Takeru that stares back at me is someone I hardly recognize."
    "Sure, I look the same, aside from a slightly contused forehead..."
    "But it's the look in those eyes staring back at me."
    "Did I ever feel this unsure of myself? I don't remember ever being worried before."
    "Sure, I'd stress a bit about a game or a test, but today feels different, and not in a positive way."
    "Maybe it's just I've never felt nervous about people before."
    "All of a sudden I can't maintain eye contact with the mirror before and I go back to brushing my teeth. I'm the same person as before, schizophrenia diagnosis or not, so I'm not sure why I've let this first morning rattle me so much."
    "A new part of my morning: I find my pills are still where I left them in the medicine cabinet at least."
    "As I measure out the dosage and swallow, I narrow my eyes at the label on the bottle."
    "Take once daily. Purpose: antipsychotic."
    "It sounds threatening, almost."
    "I guess you could consider this medication to be something like caffeine. Or maybe the opposite of a sleeping pill."
    "In theory it's supposed to make me feel like the real me. Not like someone who's having thoughts inserted or removed from their mind at random. Someone who know's what's happening in reality around them."
    "But I don't feel normal taking this."
    "Normal Takeru wouldn't have to take these."
    "I can tell when I haven't taken this pill and when I have. It stops... something anyway. It stops me from dreaming."
    "But if it stops something like that unthinkable day at Tohoku, then I have no objections."
    "Take once daily, for the rest of your natural life..."
    "I exit the bathroom without a second glance."
    
    kenta "You're finally ready! Good, you need to wake up, we're running late."
    "I'm not sure my patience can take this."
    takeru "You waited for me?"
    kenta "We're supposed to walk to school together."
    takeru "Uh..."
    "...This guy's been standing outside the door this whole time?"
    kenta "Do you even know where you're going?"
    takeru "I guess not."
    kenta "Let's get going then."
    "Wait, hang on..."
    takeru "Kenta, is your shirt on... inside out?"
    "Kenta looks down, and sure enough, I see a tag dangling out."
    kenta "Huh. That's weird. This seems to happen all the time. One minute!"
    "He runs into the bathroom."
    "So a fastidious guy like Kenta has trouble remembering something like that?"
    "What's his deal, anyway?"
    "I guess for a school like Mirako, he's probably the norm."
    "Finally, Kenta emerges from the washroom, this time with his shirt facing the right direction."
    
    kenta "Ah, Takeru, we need to hurry! It's really getting late."
    takeru "Yeah, I wonder whose fault that is..."
    kenta "Come again?"
    "I immediately regret my sarcasm. Kenta just looks confused."
    takeru "Nothing."
    "I grab my bookbag. It's uncomfortably empty, as if I've forgotten everything."
    kenta "You're ready to go then? Here, I'll show you the way. Mirako's just up the hill a ways."
    "Kenta goes on to explain the local geography in a roundabout, if thorough, way as we head out of the dorm and onto the road."
    "I'm ambivalent about him."
    "Ask the Tohoku High Takeru what he thought about Kenta and I'm sure you'd find a very different answer, but I can't currently find it in myself to be mad at this guy."
    "Even if he did sacrifice my dresser for a coin collection, at least he woke me up and is currently trying to get me to Mirako in one piece."
    "But I still can't believe I'm relying on him."
    
    "The road up from the dorm is less busy than what I'd expected. It seems despite Kenta's concerns about tardiness, it's still early. In fact, we hardly run into anyone."
    "The greenery isn't what I'd pictured either. Everything seems so much more cluttered and impulsive than the ordered edges of Tohoku."
    "And the humidity is terrifying."
    "When we reach an overpass, I stop. Laid out below, down a narrow slope, is the small town of Mirako."
    "It seems quaint. I guess it should be a reassuring scene, but for some reason I feel a twinge of nerves."
    
    kenta "What are you stopping for?"
    "Of course he's just walked straight by."
    takeru "Just the view is all."
    kenta "Huh. I guess I never noticed."
    "He doesn't pay the scenery below a second glance."
    takeru "How long have you attended school here?"
    kenta "Since my first year, but I've always gone to the schools around here. I went to junior high in Mirako as well."
    takeru "Wait, then you're not here for... a condition?"
    kenta "I have Asberger syndrome. It's a little different."
    takeru "Oh. Huh."
    kenta "I fit right in though with people like you."
    "I swivel around to face him, but he doesn't seem to think he said anything too weird."
    kenta "You'll do fine, I'm sure."
    "He has that same flat smile on his face. Maybe he wasn't judging me after all."
    "How much could he even know about me anyway?"
    takeru "You've got a funny way of speaking."
    kenta "Sorry."
    takeru "Well, whatever. You don't need to apologize."
    kenta "Sorry then. Oh, this is the main gate."
    "He gestures at the main gate as if I'd miss it."
    
    "Mirako High School is pretty much what was pictured on that card back in the ward."
    "It's a modern, two story building with a tall windowed exterior and white supports and walls."
    "It could almost pass for an office building."
    "Or maybe a postmodern hospital."
    "Here and there are other early students. They look like students anywhere else. Nothing's visibly wrong. Or I guess, why would I expect there to be?"
    takeru "I guess I should find the office or something."
    kenta "You're in 3B, right?"
    takeru "...Right. You can show me there?"
    kenta "I'm in 3A, but it's not hard to find. You see the main door, about 20 meters ahead there?"
    kenta "Alright, so if you walk straight about 10 meters, then take a right, then about 20 meters on your left there's a staircase."
    kenta "Actually it's more like 15 meters. But anyway, then head up the stairs. That should only be 10 meters up. Or, well, not the vertical elevation, but that's how far you'll walk. Next - "
    takeru "Thanks Kenta but I think I'll manage to find the room. Or I can just ask someone."
    kenta "Good luck."
    "I think I need to limit my exposure to this guy to maybe five minutes a day or risk a headache."
    "Well, risk an actual headache."
    "I rub my head from where Kenta woke me up this morning."
    "Here goes nothing. I pass through the gates."
    
    "Mirako is larger than it looks."
    "Not all the space seems to be in the same modern style, either. Some rooms are built in an older Eastern style. In fact, this whole hallway seems to be traditional."
    "How many students attend here anyway?"
    "Despite generally trying to follow Kenta's directions, I think I must've taken a wrong turn. None of the classrooms look to be in use."
    "And there doesn't seem to be anyone wandering the halls now either."
    "..."
    "I check my watch."
    "Two girls walk jog past in the opposite direction, chattering about tardiness."
    "A boy a year or two younger than me glances my way then vanishes up the stairs at the end of the hall."
    "And then it's really just me. Am I really going to be late on my first day because I was too much of a coward to ask any of these people for directions?"
    "Now I'm even missing Kenta."
    "Well, there's nothing for it. I resign myself to interrupting some random class to find someone to ask where to go."
    "The first door on the left opens with a shudder."
    "I reflexively cough. Dust is visible in the bright morning light streaming in through the windows."
    "It looks like a classroom, but clearly nobody's been in here for ages."
    "The next door is the same."
    "Inside is completely empty. There's no furniture, nothing on the walls, and not even dust on the floor, just a patch of sunlight from what filters in from outside."
    "Next door."
    "I can hardly see into this room. Odd. Of course there couldn't be anyone here if it's this dark, but I feel compelled to open the curtains anyway."
    takeru "Ow!"
    "Two steps in and I almost kill myself tripping over a low, flat table in the middle of the floor. Is this some sort of tea room?"
    takeru "There we go... Let's get the curtains opened."
    "And I leap back in shock. Please tell me I'm not seeing things again."
    takeru "H-hello."
    "???: \"Hello?\""
    takeru "Sorry, I could've sworn there was nobody in here, I don't know why I needed to open the curtains, but truth is I'm just a little lost, and..."
    "She doesn't seem to be paying me any attention."
    "If someone had wandered into my room, tripped over the furniture, then missed with the curtains, I think I'd at least pay attention to their stuttering introduction."
    takeru "I'm Ichiro Takeru. This is my first day here."
    "???: \"Welcome.\""
    "She doesn't introduce herself, nor does she put any sort of inflection into her voice at all."
    "I really don't think I'm welcome here."
    "She's seated at the low table, so I figure if I'm about to ask for instructions on how to get out of this run down wing of the building and back to my homeroom, I might as well seat myself as well."
    takeru "Sorry I barged in. I was just looking for someone who knew their way around. You look like you're here a lot."
    "???: \"...\""
    "She does look like the sort of person that would wait out their mornings in this dusty room. Her whole being seems to sum up the concept of dust."
    "Her uniform is clearly Mirako, but it seems almost as faded as the surrounding bookshelves and cabinets."
    "And maybe lurking in these unlit classrooms is how she managed to pick up her complexion."
    takeru "I'm in 3B. Do you know how I'm supposed to get there from here? I know it's a bit late..."
    "Actually, it'll definitely be late. Is it okay for her to sit around here? What was she even doing when I walked in?"
    "???: \"Hm, well... It's a little unfamiliar, but you saw the stairs at the end of the hall?\""
    takeru "Yeah."
    "???: \"Go upstairs and head left and you'll be in the new building. It's the first door on the right.\""
    "She gestures upwards in the general direction. It's a weird motion, not weak, but like she doesn't have great motor control. Or maybe only someone with my background would notice that."
    "???: \"Does that make sense?\""
    takeru "Definitely. Thanks, you're a lifesaver... and you didn't mention anything about meter distances either."
    "???: \"Hm?\""
    takeru "Sorry, it wasn't anything."
    "She doesn't seem like she'd be particularly interested in an explanation."
    "In fact she looks positively disinterested. Is she really staring out the window?"
    "Now that I at least know where I'm going, I start to feel a little more like myself."
    takeru "So this is a tea room I guess? Do you come here every morning?"
    "???: \"It's not like there's anywhere else to be.\""
    takeru "Er, right."
    takeru "I should really get to homeroom. Thanks again."
    "???: \"Any time.\""
    "Zero enthusiasm."
    takeru "I'll have to return the favor later, but er, I didn't catch your name."
    "???: \"Even if I told you, it wouldn't matter.\""
    takeru "What?"
    "???: \"Goodbye.\""
    "I want to ask more but I'm clearly being ushered out."
    takeru "Shouldn't you be getting to class as well?"
    "But I more mutter it to the hallway's wall than to the strange girl behind it."
    "Is this par for the course at Mirako?"
    "Everything's been too fast so far."
    "As I climb the stairs I just hope my grip on reality isn't starting to slip. But I took my meds this morning, I'm sure she was actually there the whole time."
    "She's probably just some shutin student, and I'm sure she won't be the weirdest person I meet here."
    
    "Finally I'm outside 3B."
    "Of course, between wandering around those unused classrooms and that terse encounter with the dusty girl, I'm well past fashionably late."
    "Inside, everyone is seated and I can hear the teacher addressing the class."
    staff "...so please keep the application deadlines in mind when thinking ahead to the festival this year."
    staff "One other bit of news -- we were supposed to have a new student today, although he doesn't seem to have shown up."
    staff "Maybe if I could have one of you check in the office..."
    "It's now or never. I steel myself and walk in."
    takeru "Sorry, I was a little lost, and..."
    "Everyone's eyes are on me now."
    staff "Ahh, you must be Ichiro Takeru."
    takeru "Right."
    staff "Right on time, how about you introduce yourself then?"
    takeru "E-er... Hello."
    "I can only stare back at these faces. I'll be spending the rest of the year with these people."
    "When was the last time I talked to a big group like this that didn't already know be as the one and only Ichiro Takeru?"
    "Why do I need an introduction? (And why can't I seem to remember how to introduce myself?)"
    "Mirako is a school specializing in mental illness and other psychiatric conditions."
    "No doubt that's all they see now. Who's the new guy? He seemed weird, maybe a mute?"
    "Hm probably not. Maybe he has anxiety attacks? Or one of those new seizure conditions?"
    "Is this the reputation I want?"
    staff "You could start with your name."
    takeru "Right. I'm Ichiro Takeru, but I guess you all already knew that. Takeru is fine. It's nice to meet - "
    "Almost as soon as I remember how to talk like a human, I see one face in the sea of many."
    "Turquoise eyes. Shoulder-length brown hair."
    "I know her. At least I knew her a long time ago, or someone like her."
    "It can't be her, can it?"
    "And just like that I'm struck dumb again. I'm saved by the teacher."
    staff "Where did you transfer from? Any hobbies?"
    takeru "Er, it was nowhere special, just public school in my hometown. My only hobby really is base - "
    "I cut myself off. I don't have hobbies any more."
    staff "Baseball?"
    takeru "No, I don't do anything like that. I'm more into..."
    "Into what? I've already mortally wounded my chance at a social life at this point so why does it matter if I bail myself out of this one?"
    staff "That's great Takeru. Everyone, please make Takeru feel welcome."
    staff "Now we're a bit behind schedule, so if you'd take your seat..."
    "Thank the lord. Ichiro Takeru, the permanent social outcast and definitely a maladjusted psychiatric case takes his seat."
    "I do my best to avoid eye contact with that green-eyed girl in the back."
    "In the end my desk is in the same row, only one seat away from hers, but I do my best."
    "If it really is her, I think I'd die of embarassment on the spot."
    "Or maybe shame."
    "It's all I can do to stare straight ahead and hope to survive the rest of my first day without incident."
    
    "The first class of the day is lost on me as a new student."
    "What isn't lost on me are my neighbors. Well, the girl to my right in particular."
    "No sooner does class end then she turns to talk to me."
    natsumi "Heya. I'm Natsumi."
    takeru "Hello."
    natsumi "What did you say your name was again?"
    takeru "Takeru is fine. Nice to meet you."
    natsumi "Aha! I called it. Ichiro Takeru. I never forget a name."
    "She pauses to eye me up and down. It's a weird motion. It doesn't help that she waggles her eyebrows when done."
    natsumi "Well, can I ask a question?"
    "As long as she doesn't ask about whatever terrible mental condition caused me to completely bungle my introduction. But she doesn't wait for my reply."
    natsumi "You said you played baseball, right?"
    takeru "No. I don't have any hobbies."
    natsumi "Damn. And I heard you transfered from Tohoku, too..."
    takeru "Er..."
    natsumi "No hobbies, huh? Wellll, let me know if you need one I guess."
    natsumi "Are you any good at math then?"
    takeru "Not really."
    "I'm not bad, I guess, but this girl seems a little persistent."
    "Actually, now that I notice, pretty much every student sitting immediately next to us is listening in."
    natsumi "Damn, I need a math buddy sitting next to me or I just know I'll fail that midterm."
    boy "Hey, Natsumi!"
    "One of the other students butts in."
    boy "You did last night's homework, right?"
    natsumi "Well, let's see..."
    "It seems that everyone knows her, actually. I sit mute next to her in a whirlwind of activity."
    "The only not paying attention to Natsumi is that girl with the green eyes."
    "She's two desks over, staring straight ahead, perfect posture."
    "Either I know her, or that girl's a doppelganger."
    "She glances over at me and I look away. Why don't I just introduce myself like a normal person?"
    "But the next class is about to start."
    "Natsumi and the others behind me are still chattering away."
    "I can't concentrate with her on my mind."
    
    "I exit the classroom at lunchtime. Things are just too hectic."
    "Before I travel more than halfway down the hall, I spot a familiar face."
    takeru "Ah, hey Kenta."
    kenta "Hm? Oh right, it's you. Hello."
    takeru "Were you going somewhere to eat lunch?"
    kenta "It is lunchtime."
    takeru "Do you usually eat by yourself?"
    kenta "Sometimes."
    "I was planning on maybe eating with him, at least to ease myself into daily life here, but Kenta stands there, almost at attention, waiting for the next question."
    takeru "Hey, Kenta..."
    kenta "Hello."
    takeru "Right. Do you know a girl in 3B, about my height, green eyes? Purple ribbon in her hair?"
    takeru "She wouldn't look out of place as a doctor or maybe as a girls' school instructor somewhere."
    kenta "A green-eyed girl that looks like a doctor?"
    takeru "That was a dumb description, I just mean she just... looks like she has everything together is all."
    kenta "Sorry, I don't know anyone like that. Or any student doctors."
    "We walk down the hall at a slow pace. I'm headed nowhere in particular at least."
    takeru "Okay, different question. How about a red-haired girl with an athletic build. Everyone seems to know her."
    kenta "Sorry."
    takeru "Her name's Natsumi. You really don't know her? I wonder what her deal is..."
    "No sooner do I mention her then the girl in question calls out from behind me."
    natsumi "Heya! Takeru! Ichiro Takeru!"
    "She walks over, leaving behind her a gaggle of four or five other friends."
    natsumi "And Undou Kenta. Hey, I haven't seen you in a while. How have things been?"
    kenta "Huh?"
    kenta "Oh, sorry. It's you. Hello."
    natsumi "You didn't forget me, did you?"
    kenta "No, sorry."
    natsumi "Hey, well, anyway Takeru, did you and Kenta want to join us for lunch?"
    natsumi "I figured you're new here and all so you probably didn't know too many people."
    "She's not wrong."
    takeru "Er..."
    "Behind her, her friends are talking to each other."
    "They're a well-built bunch, mostly guys. Actually, all guys."
    "One of them is even wearing a baseball cap, although it's indoors. He waves when he sees me looking."
    kenta "No thank you."
    "He walks off."
    natsumi "Sheesh, strange guy. How do you know him?"
    takeru "He's my roommate, actually."
    natsumi "Oh, interesting. We know each other from way back. Great friends."
    takeru "Er..."
    natsumi "Anyway, lunch?"
    "One of her friends laughs."
    takeru "I think I'll go find out what Kenta's up to, actually. Thanks for the offer though."
    natsumi "Okay, but you better take me up on that offer soon. You got that?"
    takeru "Right."
    natsumi "See ya Takeru!"
    "She walks back to her group of guys and they head off in the opposite direction, leaving me to myself."
    "Unfortunately, Kenta is nowhere to be found."
    "The hall is fairly noisy at this hour, with students walking both directions, up and down stairs..."
    "What's with that unused wing on the lower floor then, where I was lost today?"
    "Compared to the bustle up here, it seemed like I was the last person on that floor in a decade."
    "Actually, there was one other student down there..."
    "Could she still be down there, sitting in the dark?"
    "I never properly thanked her for guiding me back to the classroom."
    "Something between curiousity and compulsion moves me downstairs and over to the unused wing of Mirako High."
    
    "I slide open the doors one after the other, but no luck."
    "It's not that nobody's here (well, not that anyone's here), but I can't even seem to find the tearoom."
    "The school's bigger than I thought."
    "I don't even see anyone in this entire hallway."
    "Nothing for it. I leave the last room in the wing and step into the hall, but no sooner then I'm a foot out the door..."
    "SMACK."
    "???: \"Woah!\""
    "I'm knocked to the floor by a mighty blow from behind."
    "The ceiling spins."
    "Am I seeing stars? Everything's so white..."
    "No, wait, those aren't stars. It's raining white looseleaf paper."
    "With a light scuffling, finally the last piece lands on the floor, revealing a girl standing in front of me."
    "???: \"Are you alright?\""
    "She's a head smaller than me. She knocked me down, but stands there like it was nothing."
    takeru "Just... kind of confused."
    "She lends me a hand."
    takeru "Thanks. My name's Ichiro Takeru. I'm sorry if I got in your way, I was looking for..."
    mana "Hashimoto Mana here! What did you say you were doing down here?"
    takeru "I have no idea. Honestly, I'm a new student here, and I keep getting dragged into the weirdest stuff."
    mana "Oh neat! A transfer huh? What class?"
    takeru "I'm in 3B, but it's only my first day."
    mana "That makes you my upperclassman I guess! I'm in 2A. Oh well!"
    mana "But let's see, if you're new... Well you probably don't know this is the old wing then."
    takeru "Old wing?"
    "She's talking and picking up her papers at the same time, making it hard to hear."
    "I move to help her out. All the sheets of notebook paper are filled with sketches of doe-eyed girls and slightly misproportioned drawings of thin sparkly guys."
    mana "Yep! The old wing. It's actually not that old! There were classes down here as late as last year but then they put in the glass and top floor after the fire."
    takeru "I guess that explains all the dust."
    mana "Mhm."
    "I hand her back her drawings. She blushes."
    mana "You didn't see any of those, did you?"
    takeru "I don't know what you're talking about."
    mana "Alright, alright. But what was I saying? Yeah! So I think Hagami and I are the only ones that are ever down here, mostly. But we're usually upstairs. But Hagami's not in today."
    "She keeps talking so I keep walking beside her."
    mana "So it's your first day, huh? How's Mirako? Wait, do you live in town or in the dorm at the bottom of the hill?"
    mana "Wait, are you eating lunch down here?"
    takeru "Wasn't planning on it."
    mana "Come on upstairs then! I'll show you the old library."
    "After running into her I think I'm obligated."
    "Well, it's more like after she ran into me, but whatever."
    
    "As promised, the library is old. But more than that, it seems like a library for rejected books."
    "Along the bookshelves that line the walls, I spot English novels, Japanese manuals, Chinese textbooks..."
    "And aside from the odd fingerprint in the dust, it doesn't look like anything's been touched in years."
    "The only thing in this small room that looks like it sees regular use is the table in the center."
    "It's lit by a single overhead light. Despite being on the second floor, it's the only light source."
    mana "Pretty neat, right? What do you think?"
    "She pulls out one of the chairs at the table and gestures for me to do the same."
    takeru "What is this place, even?"
    mana "It used the be the library, a long time ago."
    takeru "A room this small?"
    "She giggles."
    mana "Maybe not for everything. Just the good books!"
    takeru "You read this stuff?"
    mana "Ehe, well, not necessarily."
    "There's a six-book high stack on the table, mostly paperbacks. Mana pushes it aside to make room for her lunch."
    "I clear a few pencils and a portable radio off the space in front of me for mine."
    mana "Maybe it's a good thing I ran into you. My other member is out today. I'd have no one to meet with."
    takeru "Other member?"
    mana "Oh, I'm in a club that meets here, but it's me and Hagami, really."
    takeru "Bookbinding or something? Or a club about card catalogues, maybe?"
    mana "Ehe, that's funny, but no. We're the supernatural club!"
    takeru "Right."
    mana "Are you in any clubs, Takeru?"
    takeru "I've been here less than five hours."
    "...and I've probably been asked that five times."
    mana "If you want to join, we're recruiting!"
    takeru "It seems a little late in the year for that."
    mana "It wasn't so important at the beginning of the year, but things are getting complicated, and, ahh, this story's boring so I won't go into details, but..."
    mana "But how's Mirako? Do you like it here?"
    takeru "It's better than a hospital I guess."
    "I don't know why I said that. I'd been doing such a good job of not sticking out too."
    mana "Ahhh. Everyone's got their own background!"
    "She's done eating already."
    mana "You should join a club though, even if you don't join mine."
    takeru "Maybe."
    mana "How about sports?"
    takeru "Er... maybe."
    mana "Swimming?"
    takeru "Maybe."
    mana "Great! If you join the swimming team you'd still be in my club!"
    takeru "..."
    mana "What's with that look?"
    takeru "I'm not quite sure that's how it works."
    mana "Oh! Alright, I hadn't thought of that. Oh well."
    mana "But put some thought in! Mirako's a great place. Lots of good people are here."
    takeru "Thanks. I'll keep it in mind."
    "I watch the particles of dust swirl in the air, lit by a beam of light from the door window."
    "It's an odd little library, almost claustrophobic. But it seems to fit."
    mana "It's almost time for class, right?"
    takeru "I think so."
    mana "Do you know how to get back? I can show you!"
    takeru "Thanks. You know, maybe that's for the best."
    
    "Classes are over sooner than I expected."
    "Before I really notice, everyone else has already packed their things and gone."
    "Does everyone really have somewhere else to be so urgently? Clubs didn't strike me as a big part of life here..."
    "...especially considering the sorry single-member state of the supernatural club."
    "The last to rise, I put together my things and prepare for the walk home."
    "As I pass through the doorway, I startle someone waiting right outside."
    "Is it her?"
    takeru "Hey..."
    "But she's already turned and walking down the hall. It's not long before I lose track of her in the traffic."
    "Once again I'm left by myself outside the classroom, staring out the tall glass windows without any purpose at all."
    "Maybe a familiar face wouldn't be that bad."
    "Natsumi of course is off somewhere with her band of followers though."
    "No sign of Kenta either. Is that a good thing or bad?"
    "Outside, the humidity is almost oppressive. Without anything else to do, I join the stream of students on the trek down the hill."
    
    "I'm at the dorm well before sunset."
    "I drop my books on top of my dresser (well, on top of Kenta's coin collection) and collapse onto the bed."
    "For me there's no homework of course."
    "It reminds me of those rare days in my old life when by some miracle, there was no practice, no work, no game scheduled for the afternoon..."
    "I used to relish those days, I think. But then I always had six or eight friends to pass the time with."
    "But as I sit and stare and the neatly arranged room, everything feels alone."
    takeru "Hello?"
    "...who was I expecting to respond?"
    takeru "I guess even Kenta's got somewhere to be."
    "Even someone like him has something to do?"
    "I need to stop thinking like that. I'm \"someone like him\" now."
    "..."
    "The room is too large for two students, but I still feel cramped."
    "I try opening the curtains but it doesn't help."
    "On a whim, I open the drawer labeled \"darks\" on Kenta's dresser."
    "Shirts, folded and laundered. Pants tucked neatly into squared. Sure enough, there's my old clothes in there, all folded and pressed like the rest."
    "This is pointless. I shut the curtains again and flop on the bed."
    takeru "What on earth did I used to do all day?"
    "Should I be concerened I don't remember?"
    "Is it that I can't remember or don't want to remember?"
    "It feels like my thoughts are chasing each other in circles. I took my pills today, right?"
    kenta "Takeru?"
    "I jump up as the door opens."
    takeru "Oh, it's just you Kenta. You scared me."
    kenta "Sorry. Who else did you think would come in here though? Oh, did you close the curtains? It's still light out."
    takeru "Hello to you too."
    "He pulls the drawstring and the slanting sunlight streams into the room."
    kenta "Hello."
    takeru "Hello?"
    kenta "You wanted me to say hello, right?"
    takeru "That's what you normally say when you see someone you know, yes. But I didn't mean you needed to say it."
    kenta "Sorry."
    takeru "There's really no need to apologize."
    kenta "Sorry."
    takeru "..."
    takeru "Is this some kind of comedy routine?"
    kenta "Sorry, was that sarcasm?"
    takeru "What? No."
    kenta "..."
    "Even bickering with Kenta is tiring me out, if you could call this bickering."
    "Talking to this guy just rapidly worsens my tangled thought process."
    "I sit on my bed with my arms on my legs and watch Kenta drop off his books."
    "He empties everything onto the desk at the far side of the room then hangs his back on a hook by the door."
    "...And then he repeats the process with my bag, spilling my paltry two textbooks onto my desk."
    takeru "Thanks, I guess."
    kenta "You're welcome."
    "He then sets about opening and closing every door in his dresser, the clang of coins filling the room."
    "Maybe it's just the humidity, but it's driving me nuts."
    kenta "I went down to the hobby shop in Mirako today."
    "I didn't ask."
    takeru "Oh."
    kenta "They close early on Mondays."
    takeru "Fascinating."
    kenta "What do you think of Mirako? It isn't too bad here, right?"
    "What do I think? I can't honestly say. There's been too much to process today."
    "Kenta and all these other people I've met are very unlike anyone else I've had to deal with. I don't belong."
    "I belong in the sense that I, a psychiatric patient, belong at a school tailored to psychiatric patients, but I'm still hit with an odd sense of culture shock."
    takeru "I don't know."
    kenta "People are always lying when they say that."
    takeru "You're very astute, Kenta."
    kenta "Thank you."
    takeru "You're welcome?"
    takeru "I just feel out of sorts is all. Nobody knows me here. My old friends would laugh at me if they saw me sitting around before it was even dark out."
    takeru "It's like there's a big pin over my head labeled 'does not belong here.'"
    "Don't ask me why I'm telling Kenta all this. I can't tell if he's listening to me complain or just nodding at the coin he has up to his eye."
    kenta "You don't have to worry about blending in. Plenty of students just live in town without any mental issues. You seem normal enough to me."
    takeru "Really? Well, I guess you would've had to know me before. Ever since - "
    kenta "Since what?"
    takeru "It doesn't matter."
    "That's as much as I'm prepared to tell Kenta, of all people."
    kenta "People say that a lot too when they're lying."
    takeru "..."
    kenta "Or did you just not want to talk about it?"
    "When I don't respond, Kenta's interest drifts back to his coins."
    "Eventually he finishes shuffling the coins around and ends up back at his desk."
    "For some reason I start wondering what my old crowd would think of Kenta."
    "Probably nothing positive. He'd be some defective kid going to a school for defective people."
    "He's less defective than me I guess. After all, he's not the one who wound up in a psych ward for a month."
    takeru "Hey Kenta."
    kenta "Hello."
    "A second ago I felt like apologizing to him, but now I forget why."
    takeru "Nothing, sorry."
    kenta "You keep bringing up things you don't want to talk about. It's very odd."
    takeru "Oh yeah?"
    kenta "It's something I don't understand about people, so it's a pet peeve of mine. Why bring it up if you don't want to talk?"
    "He doesn't continue, like he's waiting for a response."
    takeru "Am I supposed to answer?"
    kenta "That's the only reason I would ask a question."
    takeru "If you say so."
    "He's still looking at me though"
    takeru "Do you have a lot of friends, Kenta?"
    kenta "I do alright on my own."
    takeru "Then you wouldn't really understand."
    kenta "Understand what?"
    takeru "You remember those guys hanging out with Natusmi, right?"
    kenta "Who's Natsumi?"
    takeru "That redhead outside class. You talked to her, genius."
    kenta "Oh."
    takeru "Well, whatever. That used to be me. It was never just me, it was always me and my friends, me and the team..."
    takeru "Now I'm just stuck with you."
    "Kenta looks interested, but surprisingly not offended."
    kenta "It could be worse, I guess. You could be stuck with no one."
    takeru "I guess."
    kenta "I'm stuck with you and I don't think it's that bad."
    takeru "Kenta, it's been what, eight hours since we met? Or I guess since you started knocking on my forehead?"
    "I'm still pretty bitter about that, actually."
    takeru "For all you know I could be a terrible person."
    kenta "It's not so bad. You're my only friend, you know."
    "What? The headache he caused this morning is back in full force.\""
    takeru "Thanks for showing me around and all Kenta, but I think I don't think I've said a single kind thing to you."
    takeru "How does that make me your friend?"
    kenta "It's good enough for me. I bet that girl doesn't know the names of half the people following her around."
    kenta "That's too many people to keep track."
    takeru "Bravo. I remember your name, so now we're friends."
    "But Kenta is already paging through a textbook, back to work."
    "I have a sudden impulse to open the finely coded dresser and throw our categorized clothing into a big pile on the floor and then roll in it for good measure."
    
    "But before long, Kenta is at the other dresser. My dresser."
    takeru "What are you up to?"
    kenta "Opening my coin collection."
    takeru "Well that's obvious. I was wondering why."
    "Instead of replying, he turns around and hands me something."
    kenta "Here."
    "It's... copper? A coin?"
    takeru "I don't get it. Is this a penny?"
    kenta "It's a wheat penny, from the US."
    takeru "...Okay?"
    kenta "It's the start of your coin collection."
    takeru "I have a coin collection now?"
    kenta "Well, you'll have to find somewhere else to store it. This dresser has my collection and everything, but maybe if I reorganize I can clear the bottom drawer..."
    takeru "I'm still not getting it, Kenta."
    kenta "It's sharing. We share a hobby, right? That should be good enough to make us friends."
    "My immediate impulse is to hand the penny back, but... instead I start laughing."
    "I feel like that anxious weight that dropped on me this morning is just a hair lighter."
    "It's like Mirako feels that much less unnatural. Just by a hair."
    kenta "I don't see what's funny."
    takeru "I'm just happy is all, I guess. Don't ask me why. I could shake your hand right now."
    kenta "I'd rather not. Sorry."
    takeru "Thanks for the penny. Don't worry about sorting the drawer, I'll just keep my coin collection in my pocket for now."
    kenta "You're welcome."
    "And he's back at his desk, like nothing happened."
    "..."
    takeru "Hey Kenta."
    kenta "Hello. You do have something to talk about this time right?"
    takeru "Yeah, don't worry. Are you going back to that hobby shop this week?"
    kenta "Maybe."
    takeru "Feel free to find me. I'll come along."
    kenta "Alright."
    "A shop for coin collectors sounds boring as hell and I'm sure I'll hate every second of it."
    "I'm smiling anyway."

label day02:

    "Shining, plastic light..."
    "That sterile smell, still somehow offensive..."
    "Where am I?"
    "Oh. This is back at the ward again."
    "I'm not alone this time."
    "There are voices all around me."
    "My friends from Tohoku. They're all here, laughing, joking with each other. None of them look at me."
    "They can see me."
    "It's like I'm lying on the ground, looking up at a ceiling that keeps rising away."
    "Or maybe it's me that's falling down."
    
    "I wake up with a start."
    "Above me the whitewashed ceiling of the ward gives way to the dull sandy texture of my Mirako dorm."
    "Right now even rubbing my eyes feels like it'd be too much effort."
    takeru "Ah!"
    "Only by reflex do I manage to avoid the incoming blow. I sit straight up on the bed."
    "Kenta towers above me, fully dressed and brandishing his knuckles."
    takeru "I'm awake, Kenta! I'm awake, so calm down."
    kenta "You need to set an alarm."
    takeru "My alarm's set for an hour or now. If we left for school now I'm pretty sure it'd still be locked."
    kenta "It's not good to be late."
    takeru "This is going to be a long year."
    "I can't be too mad though. He did wake me up from that unnerving dream."
    kenta "You're not going back to sleep, are you?"
    takeru "No, no, just give me a minute to get up. You don't need to shepherd me around."
    takeru "And please, for all that's good, don't get me up this early tomorrow."
    "I consider myself a morning person, but if this continues, I'm going to cry."
    
    "When we pass through the gates of Mirako, it's quite a different scene from yesterday."
    "The humidity is gone this early in the morning, replaced by a sort of mountain mist."
    "Contrary to my prediction, the school building is indeed unlocked, but hardly anyone is here. Aren't there any morning practices or things like that?"
    kenta "I'm headed to class. Goodbye."
    takeru "Goodbye? That sounds a little formal."
    kenta "Goodbye."
    takeru "Right, see you later Kenta."
    "I'm left with a morning to my own in front of the Mirako doors. Not that I have anything in particular on my agenda."
    "This time I at least manage to find my way to the right classroom."
    "It's completely empty, of course. The lights aren't even on. I have nothing else to do, but sitting alone in an unlit room would just be sad."
    "Although, that reminds me... That rundown tearoom and its rundown inhabitant come to mind."
    "I'm a little more confident in my ability to keep my sense of direction in that wing of the school now, so I can't think of anything better to do than find that room again."
    "It doesn't take long to find that forgotten Eastern-style corridor on the first floor, but to my surprise, this time I find the room I'm looking for right away."
    "As the door slides open I cough a bit at the stirred dust."
    takeru "Hello?"
    "Well, of course nobody replies. That girl would have to be twice as weird as I thought to not only sit in this room but also show up to school this early."
    "I make my way around the table this time, navigating by the filtered light."
    "As I throw open the curtains, I'm finally able to get a decent view of the room."
    "Bookcases and shelves line one wall, stacked with teacups, chess sets, calligraphy equipment, and books almost as varied as the old library one floor above."
    "The low table that tripped me yesterday is positioned in the middle of the room, but wait, seated at it, there's..."
    takeru "When did you get here?"
    girl "I've always been here."
    takeru "Well, sorry for barging in I guess, I just figured this place was empty all the time."
    girl "It usually is."
    takeru "You were here yesterday morning too though right?"
    girl "I..."
    girl "Yesterday?"
    "What little color there was in her face has now completely vanished."
    takeru "That was you, right?"
    girl "You remembered."
    takeru "It'd be a little hard to forget."
    girl "It's just... You should forget I said that."
    girl "Do you remember my name?"
    takeru "You never gave it."
    girl "It's... Hikari."
    takeru "I'm Takeru."
    hikari "Yes, I already knew that."
    takeru "Well it'd feel weird to not say anything after you introduced yourself."
    hikari "You could say 'nice to meet you.'"
    takeru "Nice to meet you."
    hikari "Now why don't you take a seat?"
    "She seems about twice as lively as yesterday. It's like some circuit finally connected and her voice gained a small bit of color from that toneless speech she used before."
    takeru "You're a student here, right?"
    hikari "The uniform didn't tip you off?"
    takeru "Well you didn't seem very concerned about classes yesterday morning."
    hikari "Mirako's a school for very different people. Some of us are afforded different allowances."
    takeru "What's that supposed to mean?"
    hikari "It means you shouldn't trouble yourself whether I'm in class or not."
    takeru "Huh... even the superstar seniors back at Tohoku would get in trouble for skipping like that."
    hikari "I'm a third year student as well, but it's really not related to that."
    takeru "I'm in 3B. You're not my classmate, are you?"
    "She laughs. It's a soft murmur, and almost unsettling."
    hikari "Afraid not."
    hikari "I know it's a little taboo to ask, but what brings you to Mirako? You said you were a transfer, right?"
    takeru "Yeah, I transfered in for health reasons, but..."
    hikari "It's alright if you don't want to talk about it."
    "I don't know why I'm so self-conscious about my schizophrenia. As long as I take those pills once a day, it's supposed to be a small part of my life."
    "But every once in a while I start to see the corners fray."
    "That dream this morning for instance. Or those times I'm left alone and my thoughts get wrapped into some tangled mobius."
    "Years of polite and impolite society have trained me to not show that weakness. I'm not sure what's normal at Mirako, but in any case, I'm still partially on guard with this Hikari."
    takeru "Sorry."
    hikari "Oh, no, you don't have to apologize. I'm really quite glad you're here, so I didn't mean to offend. I only thought there was some reason..."
    hikari "You should forget I said that."
    "She has a funny way of speaking, sometimes flat, sometimes bright."
    "Curious as I am, I think it'd be rude to ask her what exactly gives her free reign around here, seeing as how I just dodged that question myself."
    takeru "You're down here often, then?"
    hikari "Mhm. It's a good place, quiet and familiar."
    takeru "Seems a little too dark and dusty for me."
    hikari "It's quite rare to see anyone besides myself down here, though, or even in this wing of the school."
    takeru "I saw one or two students around yesterday morning. Plus that other girl and her club. Mana, I think her name was."
    "Hikari raises an eyebrow. It's a funny gesture, and her face twitches into shape as if she'd forgotten how to use it."
    hikari "A friend of yours?"
    takeru "Maybe not. Well, as much as I have any friends around here, really."
    hikari "..."
    "I stare back."
    hikari "..."
    takeru "You know her?"
    hikari "No."
    hikari "Really, just forget I said anything."
    takeru "My memory isn't that slippery, you know."
    hikari "Forgetting seems so easy for everyone else..."
    "She's staring again, but this time, not at me, more... through me."
    takeru "Sorry I mentioned it."
    hikari "..."
    "I swear everyone in this school is impossible to deal with."
    takeru "I should probably be getting to class."
    "I'm on my feet and at the door before she shows any signs of registering my words."
    hikari "Wait! You'll be back, right?"
    takeru "Back?"
    "While I guess I find Hikari... curious, I'm not sure I'm prepared to deal with her confusing speech in that dreary room on a regular basis, especially not this early."
    takeru "We're in the same year. I'm sure we'll run into each other."
    "That doesn't seem to satisfy her."
    hikari "Then have a good day."
    hikari "...do you still remember my name?"
    takeru "Hikari."
    "Hikari smirks at her own name."
    hikari "Thanks. See you around then."
    takeru "Yeah."
    
    "I retrace my steps from yesterday morning back up the stairs to the modern half of Mirako."
    "It's not quite as late as I thought. Students are still wandering outside and the halls are only starting to fill up. That old room must've thrown off my sense of time."
    "One unfamiliar face goes by, then another..."
    "It's not like there are any familiar faces here anyway."
    "Well, there are one or two, I guess. I finger Kenta's penny in my pocket and internally roll my eyes. Better than nothing."
    "As I take my time traversing the hall, I start to pay more attention to the unfamiliar faces."
    "They seem normal to me."
    "More normal than I seem to myself, anyway."
    "When I first read that pamphlet on Mirako, back in my bed at the ward, I imagined it as being more like the hospital in some ways."
    "Back there, everyone was visibly damaged. Sure, sometimes they were like me and could carry on a conversation for a while, assuming the doctors got the balance of meds right that day."
    "And you could chat with one or two about a good movie or sports or something for a bit, but then there were always the scars. Or just that look in their eyes."
    "And then there were others. The woman across the hall. The night she couldn't stop screaming."
    "..."
    "Everyone here is fine. Unfamiliar, but fine."
    "Then why should one strange student in the old wing throw me off so much? I need to shake it off and start thinking like a normal person again."
    
    "I think I've sufficiently recovered from that runin in the old wing to get back to the real world and back to class."
    "But as I round the corner, just outside the classroom, there's one familiar face."
    "There's no mistaking her this time. Almost as tall as I am, eyes truly turquoise, not just green..."
    "Meiko."
    "And she's right in front of me. No half glances or hesitation today. Almost as if she's on guard, and on guard for me."
    meiko "Takeru! There you are. You didn't say anything yesterday, and it's been so long!"
    takeru "Kotaru Meiko. It really is you. I almost didn't recognize you."
    "How could anyone not recognize her, even after five years? It's more like I recognized her but didn't want to believe."
    meiko "How could you not recognize your best friend?"
    takeru "Er, it really has been a long time. It's good to see you."
    meiko "You too. I'm really thrilled."
    "Meiko offers a full smile, but I can only meekly grin in return."
    meiko "You'll have to let me show you around Mirako. It's just too wonderful that you're back. I thought the next time I'd see you, it'd be a headline photo in the daily sports section."
    takeru "Er, well..."
    "No no no I am not prepared for this."
    takeru "It'd be nice to have someone in class to help me get settled, I guess, if it's not too much trouble."
    meiko "Too much trouble? There's no way I wouldn't help someone out."
    meiko "Don't hesitate to think of me as your friend, even if it has been five years."
    "It's not just time that's between us Meiko. Why do you keep pretending that?"
    takeru "Right, well... You'll have to let me know what you've been up to in the meantime."
    "Something in the corner of Meiko's eye looks off-character, just for a moment."
    meiko "Of course. And you too! We'll have to sit and have a long chat some time, but for now I've got to get my notes together for this morning."
    "Notes?"
    meiko "Don't hesitate to ask if you need anything, anything at all."
    
    "I find my desk."
    "I thought it'd be around a hundred years before I saw her again. Instead, it's only been five."
    "In all those five years, I think I've thought of her maybe twice. Maybe? More than that, at the beginning."
    "It's all very foggy."
    "Were we best friends? Maybe. Although to me now she seems unforgettable, five years ago, I was in a very different place."
    "To my confusion (and slight relief) she doesn't follow my back to the third row of desks."
    "Instead she's... standing at the lectern?"
    meiko "Good morning everyone. I hope you're all well. There's nothing much new today, but please remember the deadline for any student submissions to the annual festival are due to the end of the week."
    meiko "You can hand them in to me or any other student council members, and I can fill in some of the details if there's any confusion."
    meiko "But get everything in on time. We're not taking anything late and tardiness will not be tolerated."
    meiko "Have a good day."
    "So I guess she's a student council member. And the class rep. It's really not what I would've expected from her at all."
    "Meiko retakes her seat only one desk away from mine. The desk between us, where Natsumi was sitting yesterday, is empty. Meiko takes advantage."
    meiko "So you're here, Takeru. Are you living in Mirako?"
    takeru "No, I'm in the dorms."
    meiko "Oh, that's great. I'm in a dorm as well but I've lived here for over two years now so I'm pretty familiar with Mirako."
    meiko "Are you doing anything after school today? We could grab coffee or something and catch up. I think it's the least I can do to welcome you to a new school."
    takeru "Er, maybe. I might've had plans with my roommate. I'm not sure."
    "I can't relax around her, that's true. But I don't know what compelled me to dodge this specific invite."
    meiko "Wow, you're already busy. I'm glad you're adjusting well."
    "Her smile looks genuine enough."
    takeru "Er, thanks."
    meiko "How about tomorrow then? There aren't any classes but I'll need to come in to school for the student council meeting. I should be free afterwards though. How about it?"
    takeru "That sounds fine. Don't feel obligated to do anything for me, though. I know we didn't well, when..."
    "She only laughs in return. Am I the only one that finds this at all uncomfortable?"
    meiko "You worry too much. How about I meet you at Mirako after lunch and we'll walk to town?"
    takeru "Right. Sounds good."
    meiko "So what are you plans today? You said something about your roommate?"
    takeru "Er..."
    "Luckily I'm saved by the arrival of Natsumi."
    natsumi "'Morning Takeru. Hey Meiko."
    meiko "Good morning. Don't you think it's a little late?"
    natsumi "If the teacher's not here yet, I can't be late, can I?"
    meiko "Please, if you missed be speak you should definitely be here earlier."
    natsumi "Sorry, sorry! I'd rather listen to you then the homeroom teacher anyway."
    meiko "Anyway, but what I was saying, Takeru..."
    "I guess I'm not saved after all. Well it's not like I can run away from her forever, with her sitting right there and all."
    meiko "It's really a beautiful town. Plenty of students hardly ever leave the hill, but the countryside is really amazing."
    meiko "It's nostalgic. You remember that big hill we used to climb all the time? That road to the cemetary, with all the switchbacks?"
    takeru "I remember."
    "For the Meiko I remember though, these would not be happy memories."
    takeru "I'll look forward to grabbing coffee and catching up, then."
    natsumi "Oh? You guys know each other?"
    takeru "Er, yes, but it's a little..."
    meiko "We were best friends growing up. Inseperable. Takeru lived right down the road from me before we went to different high schools."
    meiko "We'd do everything together. Takeru's a very kind person. He'd play catch with me, help me study for tests in middle school..."
    natsumi "Like you'd ever need help on a test..."
    meiko "It wasn't always so easy, haha."
    natsumi "And you're going out later? I'm jealous..."
    meiko "We've got a lot of catching up to do. Isn't that right, Takeru?"
    takeru "Right."
    "And with that our teacher arrives."
    
    "Morning classes grind by."
    "I'm thankfully excused from a history quiz that covered last week's material, so I'm left with nothing to do but stare at my hands."
    "I really need to pick up a hobby. Reading or something."
    "Next to me, Natsumi grunts in frustration, bent over her paper."
    "I think I catch a smirk on Meiko's face at next desk over. She's sitting up straight and dignified, apparently already done?"
    "It feels wrong."
    "Meiko, my childhood friend, was troubled."
    "She tried at school, sure, but she was always stressed or there was always something going on at home holding her back."
    "She tried making friends, but I don't remember more than a few... or anyone really. I don't want to dwell on this."
    "Finally, time's up."
    "Natsumi catches me looking her way and gives an exasperated shake of her head."
    "..."
    "I'm still trying to get used to the way things are done here so the rather bland lesson manages to hold my attention through until lunch, unheard of at Tohoku."
    "Lunch, however, I definitely don't quite have a routine yet."
    "I figure it's worth seeing if I can find Kenta or even that girl I met yesterday, Mana, although she said she's always in that library."
    "Instead, no sooner am I out the classroom door than I'm ambushed."
    natsumi "Heya Takeru."
    takeru "Oh, it's only you. Hello Natsumi."
    natsumi "Only me? I'm plenty good."
    "I more meant that crowd that seems to follow her around has mostly dispersed."
    "...and that I prefer talking to this easygoing girl than another tense encounter with Meiko."
    natsumi "That's so funny you know Meiko."
    takeru "I guess. I almost didn't recognize her yesterday."
    natsumi "You were best friends in middle school though! I bet you two were really cute."
    takeru "It's definitely been a while. I guess you know her too?"
    "Well that's a dumb question, they literally sit next to each other. Not that I have anything better to add to this conversation."
    natsumi "Oh, I know everyone here pretty much, but Meiko's great. Always working so hard on the student council, aceing every test... She's pretty much my hero."
    meiko "I can hear you, you know. You give me grief all the time."
    "Where'd she come from?"
    natsumi "Sorry, sorry, we can't all be as perfect as you Meiko."
    meiko "You're practically the school idol anyway, so I'm sure you could find a better hero."
    natsumi "Mmm, that won't really matter if I graduate like this, though. But you're set for life, aren't you? What are you going to be again?"
    meiko "Lawyer."
    natsumi "That's too stuffy."
    "Luckily enough, I spot Kenta coming our way."
    takeru "Hi Kenta. Over here!"
    kenta "Hello Takeru."
    natsumi "Well if it isn't Kenta!"
    kenta "Do I know you?"
    meiko "It's Natsumi. You have to remember by now, right Kenta?"
    kenta "Sorry. Hello Meiko."
    meiko "It's good to see you Kenta."
    natsumi "I'm hurt... But hey! Meiko, did you know these guys are roommates?"
    meiko "That's great. Kenta's a good guy. You're in good hands, Takeru."
    "Does she mean that he's going to be the one looking after me?"
    "I'm at least a little reassured that everyone here seems to know each other. There's no reason it can't be the same for me."
    natsumi "Practice calls! See ya later!"
    meiko "I'm eating with the student council today. We have a bunch of applications to go through and if I'm not there I'm sure the work will be sloppy."
    meiko "Enjoy your meal."
    "I'm left with just Kenta."
    kenta "Goodbye."
    "And now I'm left with just myself."
    "Did Kenta not even bother with an excuse? Maybe Meiko was right, I really have been relying on him a bit more than I realized, or at least more than I expected to."
    
    "I reenter the classroom, but I really have no desire to eat here. I still know pretty much no one aside from Natsumi and Meiko."
    "I exit again."
    "Staring out the glass of the school's front, I see students moving down below on the main path."
    "Maybe I should go outside just to have somewhere to go. Being indoors all day feels unnatural, like being stuck at the ward again."
    "But as I turn around..."
    mana "Woah!"
    "A sharp pain to the elbow."
    "I turn around to none other than Mana, spinning off balance. She'll topple over any second. I immediately catch her shoulders."
    takeru "I'm so sorry. I must've turned around and clipped you."
    mana "Everything is spinning..."
    takeru "Are you alright?"
    mana "Just dizzy..."
    takeru "Do you need me to walk you to the nurse or something? I mean not that I know where the nurse's office is, but..."
    mana "Oh, that's right! It's you, Takeru!"
    "Mana shakes her head back and forth a few times. Did she snap out of it?"
    mana "Sorry sorry sorry, it's my fault, I was running because I didn't want to hold up Hagami, and I was going to study with the swim team today, and..."
    takeru "I was just wandering around. I won't hold you up then if you're in a rush."
    mana "Oh no no no it's nothing like that. You were just wandering around?"
    takeru "Er..."
    "I don't want to have to explain to this younger girl that I really have nowhere to go."
    mana "Oh right! You're a transfer so you probably don't have anyone to eat with."
    "Looks like she guessed it anyway."
    mana "Why don't you come on up to the old library again? It really is the best. And wasn't it fun, yesterday?"
    takeru "Yeah, I guess it wasn't so bad."
    mana "And it'll be a little less lonely than eating by yourself. Come on!"
    "She practically pulls me ahead through the busy hall. I dodge a few students coming the opposite direction and we finally arrive at the staircase up to the top floor."
    mana "Have you been up on the roof before?"
    takeru "No, not really."
    mana "Here we are!"
    "The stairs open out onto the top of Mirako High School."
    "The humidity is back at full blast and there's not a single spot on Mirako's white cement roof that isn't touched by the overhead sun."
    "We cross by a few tables and students settling down to the stairs on the other half of the building, the old wing."
    "The contrast is immediate. Everything inside seems pale and unhealthy. But the girl next to me saunters through it just the same."
    
    "Finally we come to the library door with its solitary window. But Mana stops dead."
    mana "Oh! That's right. You haven't met Hagami."
    "She shakes her head a bit, turns to me and gives a vigurous nod, then opens the door with a brandish."
    mana "There's nothing for it, I'll just do the introductions. After you!"
    "The library's mostly what I remember from yesterday. Books on the walls, books on the table, and the single light a poor imitation of the sun outside."
    "But seated at the table is someone I don't recognize."
    "Long dark hair, dark eyes... Is this Hagami?"
    takeru "Hello, I'm..."
    "She's staring right at me. But it's less a stare and more... It's like she's looking straight through. There's no eye contact."
    mana "Woah!"
    "...and then of course Mana bumps into me from behind, knocking me through the doorway."
    mana "Sorry! I thought you were already in!"
    takeru "Er, no worries..."
    mana "Hi Hagami!"
    hagami "Hey."
    "It takes her a few seconds to say even that single syllable. Mana makes some pained expression."
    mana "I know I probably should've checked ahead with you, but this is Takeru. He's a new student so he's going to be our guest today."
    takeru "It's nice to meet you."
    hagami "..."
    mana "And this is Hagami. She's the other half of the supernatural club and an all-round decent person!"
    hagami "Hello."
    "Still no eye contact."
    mana "You can be an honorary supernatural club member for this lunchtime. How's that sound, Takeru?"
    takeru "Better than nothing."
    mana "Hagami, Takeru's not such a bad guy. He's a transfer. I ran into him yesterday in the old wing. We'll have to explain the back entrance, and maybe the secret passage, and..."
    hagami "...I haven't met him yet."
    mana "Mmm let's see."
    "Mana squints at me, then draws closer and closes one eye. As soon as she gets so close that I start feeling uncomfortable, she withdraws."
    mana "Looks healthy to me."
    takeru "Are you a physician or something?"
    mana "Nope! But I think he's a decent guy, Hagami. That's just my feeling. Now why don't we eat?"
    "I push the old radio to the other end of the table as I take the seat opposite Hagami."
    "Next to me, Mana pulls out a box lunch and paperbook book, as if there weren't enough books on the table already."
    "For her part, Hagami remains motionless."
    mana "Hagami, did you already eat?"
    hagami "...My appetite is funny."
    "I notice her food is laid out in front of her. But it's untouched."
    "I try my best to eat in this uncomfortable atmosphere. Maybe I should find the cafeteria tomorrow."
    "Mana doesn't seem to notice, or maybe she just doesn't mind. I can't tell which she's doing faster, flipping pages or eating."
    "I risk a glance at Hagami. She's still there, staring. Not at me, just through me. She looks away."
    mana "Oh shoot!"
    "She jumps out of her chair, performing some sort of miraculous triple take in the process. Her lunch almost ends up in my lap."
    mana "I was supposed to review those notes with Yumi today! And if she fails that test I'm gonna get kicked off the swim team for sure! Shoot!"
    "I look on in bewilderment as Mana shovels half her food into her mouth and the other half into her bookbag."
    "Across from me, Hagami looks just as incredulous."
    mana "I'll be right back, Hagami, I swear!"
    "The door closes with a slam and Hagami and I are left looking each other."
    "Well, I guess I'm looking at her. She's starting right through me."
    "She looks away."
    "The only noise I detect is a faint hum, almost static. The antique radio must be on."
    "I continue eating in silence. Hagami continues to not eat. In silence."
    takeru "Right... Well, how do you know Mana?"
    hagami "School."
    takeru "Great. I just met her in the old wing yesterday. I guess Mana already told you I'm a new transfer, so..."
    takeru "You guys must be in the same class then?"
    hagami "No."
    takeru "You do look older, I guess. Are you in my year?"
    "A nod is all I get."
    takeru "Er, Mana should be back soon, right?"
    "I have no energy for smalltalk. This much has exhausted me already and it's like talking to a monosyllabic sockpuppet."
    "Does Mana seriously eat up here with her every day? Do they talk to each other? Do they sit in silence and read? I don't get it."
    "Or maybe Mana just makes it a habit of befriending the weirdest people she literally runs into."
    "Whatever the case, I'm not welcome here."
    takeru "Sorry if I'm making you uncomfortable."
    hagami "...It's fine."
    takeru "I mean, you can go ahead and eat if you want. I'd hate for you to miss out on lunch because I showed up."
    hagami "..."
    "In lieu of a reply, she repackages the containers arranged in front of her and returns them to her bag. Good going, me."
    "Hagami rises from the table and pushes in her chair. For a moment I think I've offended her to the point where she's just going to walk out."
    "Instead, she returns with one of the books from the wall, as if there weren't enough piled on the table already."
    "This one's a green, leather-bound monstrosity that's about the size of the radio. Probably heavier, too."
    "She sets in down at her place on the table with a wham that scatters dust from the surface."
    takeru "Ah! What is that? Some sort of textbook? It's huge."
    takeru "Well, either a textbook or some sort of collection of the Russian masters."
    "My lousy attempt at humor succeeds in getting some emotion out of Hagami for once."
    "Except it's only a mixed look of pity and expasperation."
    "She gestures at the front cover."
    takeru "It's... 'A Brief History of Eidolon Theory (and other post-Hume metaphysics)'."
    takeru "Oh."
    "I repress the urge to gag."
    takeru "Is it some kind of gag book that you hide a key in or something?"
    hagami "No."
    "This time I wasn't even joking."
    "Hagami props the book up on the table so I'm left to stare at the spine."
    "I take a glance at my watch. Fifteen minutes until classes start..."
    "Would it be rude of me to leave?"
    takeru "Didn't Mana say she'd only be gone a minute or two? I don't think she's coming back, so..."
    hagami "Mana always keeps her word."
    hagami "She'll be back."
    "She doesn't bother looking over the edge of her book to pronounce, she just states it as fact."
    takeru "Alright."
    takeru "I guess it would be impolite to leave before she got back... And she left her book here anyway, so I guess she's coming."
    "There's nothing I can do about it, really."
    "My eyes wander around the confines of the library once again. There's nothing in here I'd read once in a million years. Are these girls actually into this stuff?"
    "I don't dare trying to strike up any more conversation with Hagami. Obviously her post-Humian whatevers are more interesting that whatever drivel's on my mind."
    "But the longer I sit here, the more antsy I get."
    "That strange hum isn't helping. For a moment there it almost sounded like a human voice."
    "Actually... that's the radio. Someone must've left it on."
    "After another thirty seconds of humming shaves off a sliver of my sanity, I reach for the knob and shut off the radio."
    "Almost immediately, a hand shoots out from beyond the Brief History and turns it back on."
    takeru "Sorry. I didn't know you were listening to that. Isn't that just static?"
    hagami "Listen closer."
    "If I lean closer to the radio, I can just make out the music."
    takeru "Oh, it's an orchestra. Okay."
    "HAGAMI \"...You know the piece?\""
    takeru "No."
    hagami "Oh well..."
    takeru "You sound disappointed. Sorry."
    hagami "If it bothers you, you can turn it off. Sorry."
    takeru "That's alright."
    "I wish Hagami would actually look up at me from behind that tome when she's talking. That book practically muffles her already low reply."
    takeru "..."
    "She turns a knob and the volume rises, slightly."
    "I think that was supposed to be for me, but I don't see what it accomplishes. Now my waiting just has some tinny background music. Great."
    "Without anything better to do, I shuffle around the books that take up most of the tablespace."
    "They're all pretty heavy. Nothing as dense as what Hagami hauled over from the shelf, but still... I spot an English typewriting manual and some treatise on ancient Chinese philosophy."
    "The only interesting one of the bunch is the book Mana left behind. There's no title on the front, just an illustration of a boy staring up at a starry sky."
    "I open to the bookmark. It's... well... some kind of cloying teen romance. Apparently I flipped to the protagonist's first kiss."
    "I raise an eyebrow and replace the bookmark."
    "When I look up again, Hagami is staring at me. She also has one eyebrow raised."
    takeru "I was just bored, okay?"
    "In response, she rises and walks to the shelf walls. In ten seconds, she's back with a book roughly the shape and density of a concrete brick."
    takeru "Is this for me?"
    "Wordlessly she places it in front of me and flips it open."
    "I'm supposed to be reading \"A Deconstructive Analysis of the Babylonian Funeral Dirge.\""
    "Have mercy on me..."
    hagami "You'll enjoy it more than that romance novel."
    takeru "Hagami, I have trouble getting through the stuff we read for class, let alone..."
    "Wait."
    "While Hagami isn't smiling, her head's to one side. I've been had."
    takeru "Very funny."
    hagami "...Sorry for the poor joke."
    takeru "Ah. Well you had me fooled."
    hagami "It was rude of me."
    "And she withdraws back into that green leather beast."
    "Without a moment's notice, Mana tumbles through the door."
    mana "Sorry I'm late, I got held by the teacher, and then I forgot and went to my next class, and then..."
    "She stumbles into the seat next to me."
    hagami "Welcome back."
    mana "Takeru, you were reading that thing?"
    takeru "Er.."
    "She's spotted the brick in front of me."
    mana "That's so cool! I thought only Hagami was into this stuff! You guys will have to show me what's good one of these days. Did you guys talk about old books and stuff while I was gone?"
    takeru "Not quite..."
    "Hagami has a tortured face on and I think the responsiblity to explain might fall on me."
    "But as I do so, it's painful to watch the enthusiasm drain out of Mana."
    "She's still bright as ever when we part ways outside the old library, but it's clear she was very excited to think Hagami had made an inroad with her hobby."
    "Maybe there's a reason the supernatural club only has two members."
    takeru "See you later, Mana."
    mana "Bye Takeru! You'll be back tomorrow, right?"
    takeru "Er, I don't know, but we'll see."
    "We'll see indeed."
    
    "Back at class, it looks like I left the library a little later than I should have."
    natsumi "Well looks who decided to show up."
    takeru "I guess I was the last back..."
    natsumi "Yeah, you make me look good. I told Meiko I might have had to send out a rescue party."
    "I look over Natsumi's desk to Meiko, but she's deep in concentration reviewing a sheaf of copy paper."
    "Natsumi notices the direction of my attention."
    natsumi "It must be that festival stuff. Meiko's gonna work herself to death one of these days."
    takeru "Festival, huh..."
    natsumi "Yep, world-famous. Well maybe not quite but hey I'm looking forward to it."
    natsumi "But I'm more busy with the tournament earlier that week though... Can't be worrying about fun and games until after that!"
    takeru "Tournament? Are you in like a debate league or something?"
    natsumi "Debate? As if!"
    "She openly laughs."
    natsumi "I play baseball."
    takeru "Ah."
    natsumi "I practically live for baseball. When I retire, I mean, graduate, they could practically name Mirako's field after me!"
    takeru "That's... really interesting."
    "I hope she can't see I'm sweating."
    natsumi "What's wrong? Are you not big into girls in sports? One of those weird athlete guys with something to prove? You did look kind of look like you had some muscle tone to you..."
    takeru "Oh quit staring at me, I'll get self-conscious. It was just a surprise is all."
    meiko "She's the captain, too."
    "Meiko was apparently paying attention."
    takeru "No kidding."
    natsumi "Hey, I told you I was serious. I'm pretty good too. Did you know we got a shot at regionals this year? A country school like Mirako."
    natsumi "Since I took over as captain it's been nothing but success."
    meiko "Overconfidence is unbecoming."
    natsumi "Oh let me have my fun."
    natsumi "We play pretty well."
    takeru "I can imagine."
    natsumi "Come on out to practice sometime."
    takeru "Maybe I will."
    "I definitely won't."
    "At least this explains why everyone seems to follow her around. Maybe they're her players, or maybe they're just adoring fans."
    "As class begins I'm struck with just a bit of jealousy."
    "That's what unsettled me before when I saw those guys trailing her. It felt like me. I saw me in her."
    "Or at least old me."
    "Is that some sort of curse? Every day I'm to sit next to some half rate imitation of myself that I can never be again."
    "Captain of a country school baseball team... I bet they hardly have bleachers."
    "Why am I jealous? Aren't I better than that? Well, no, I'm worse than that. I'm beneath her."
    "I need to snap out of it. Everything seems to be running away again."
    
    "Not a moment too soon, the last class of the day comes to a close."
    "On my way out, I find Kenta standing by the gate and we both turn to walk down the hill."
    kenta "Hello."
    takeru "Hey Kenta. That's another day down I guess."
    kenta "Correct. Luckily we have many left."
    "Was that supposed to sound so philosophical?"
    kenta "What do you think of Mirako? Now that you're through with another day."
    "I'm about to deflect when I remember his annoyance yesterday."
    takeru "It's alright. Still not familiar, but... we'll see."
    kenta "Good."
    kenta "I think someone's waving to you Takeru."
    takeru "What?"
    "Sure enough, back at the top of the hill, there's a silhouette."
    meiko "Have a good evening, Takeru! And you won't forget about tomorrow, right?"
    takeru "Nope. I'll see you at lunch. Bye."
    kenta "She's an unusualy one."
    takeru "Meiko? When I described her yesterday you said you didn't know her."
    kenta "Sorry."
    "We reach a turn on the hill road. Left to town, right to the dorms."
    takeru "Oh... that's right. You're not going to that coin shop today, are you?"
    kenta "Coin shop?"
    takeru "It was closed yesterday."
    kenta "No. Coins are rather uninteresting."
    takeru "Er... Alright then."
    "I'm worried if I probe any further I'll end up behind a ramshackle counter somewhere where a man with a goatee explains the finer points of a Roman denarius."
    takeru "Back to the dorm it is then."
    kenta "Yes. There's lots of work to get done tonight."
    takeru "My homework looks pretty okay..."
    kenta "Good. You can help me resort the dresser. I have a good color scheme in mind. Lights and darks is too narrowminded. I'm sure you'll agree this new plan is..."
    "Damn it. I should've gone to the hobby shop."
    

label day03a:

    "Morning in our room is a nightmare."
    "For once I was allowed to sleep in, but as soon as I wake up I realize at what cost."
    takeru "Kenta."
    kenta "Good morning Takeru."
    takeru "What is this?"
    kenta "What is what? And you're supposed to say 'good morning.'"
    takeru "Good morning Kenta."
    kenta "Good morning Takeru."
    takeru "Now what is... this?"
    "I gesture at the carnage at the foot of my bed."
    takeru "Why are there coins all over the floor? Why are there clothes all over the dressers? Where are the dresser drawers?"
    kenta "I'm categorizing the coins for storage. They're kind of taking up a lot of space."
    takeru "Well I'm glad you've wised up about that one. Does this mean I get my dresser back?"
    kenta "Your dresser? I thought we shared a dresser."
    takeru "Er, yeah, but I didn't exactly... Let me just get my clothes."
    "No sooner do I step out of bed then Kenta leaps up in terror."
    kenta "Hey! Watch out!"
    takeru "What?"
    kenta "Your foot! You're standing in the Americas collection. That's sorted by date you know."
    "I look down. It's all coins to me."
    "Actually, I'm pretty much trapped by coins. Surrounded."
    kenta "If you need to get up, we can move some of the collections."
    takeru "I'm sorry Kenta, I need to get up to Mirako for lunch. Can you just throw me my clothes or something?"
    kenta "Are you looking for a patterned shirt today or color? The socks are coded by their matches as well, one per shirt. You'll find I have a good eye for men's fashion as well."
    takeru "Can you even say that with a straight face? Your shirt's on backwards again."
    kenta "Oh. So it is."
    takeru "Just tell me where I can find some pants."
    "Kenta points at the top of what should by all rights be my dresser. A stack of tightly folded clothes lie on top, but the dresser itself is surrounded by a minefield of coins."
    kenta "Semi-formal and formal are over there. Casual clothes I've temporarily relocated to the bathroom."
    takeru "You know what, I'm just going back to bed."
    "Just as I was starting to think I could find some sense of normalcy here. Oh well."
    "It takes me twice as long as it should to traverse the dorm via a tiptoe and jumps, and not without a few nervous admonishments from Kenta."
    
    "By the time I find myself outside it's already noon. My only consolation is that when I return, I might actually have some private space in my own room."
    "Well, or I could have a dresser full of trifolded socks, but I need to think positive ahead of my meeting with Meiko."
    "Meeting sounds too formal. It certainly isn't a date. I don't know how she so nonchalantly managed to ask me to catch up over coffee."
    "She doesn't feel awkward about our parting at all? Even so, it's just the way things go that opposite sex friendships fall apart towards middle school."
    "For her to be so self-assured seems like she's got everything figured out already."
    "And it's also not what I would've expected of her."
    "While I'm not feeling nervous, I'm more... incredulous? Or ashamed I can't greet my friend with a clean conscience? Again, there's no good word for it."
    "..."
    "It's no use worrying now. I need to pick up my pace if I want to get up this hill at a reasonable hour."
    
    "I arrive at the gate sweating a bit from extertion. Mirako still seems so hot this late in the summer."
    "Where was I supposed to meet Meiko again? She said she had business with the student council or something?"
    "In the distance I here a dull clang."
    "An aluminum bat meeting a ball."
    "What should be nostalgic instead sets me on edge. I'll wait inside."
    meiko "Takeru! You made it."
    takeru "Ah! Hi. I didn't see you, sorry."
    "It's like she was lying in ambush at the school doors."
    meiko "I was waiting outside but the sun started to get to me."
    takeru "Sorry for keeping you, I ran into some... issues at my dorm."
    meiko "Haha, you'll have to tell me about. You room with Kenta, right?"
    takeru "Yeah."
    meiko "Well first why don't we figure out where we're going?"
    takeru "I'm sorry if I'm not much help deciding."
    meiko "Don't worry about that. There's a good cafe in town I know. Let's start walking now though, it'd be a shame to get there and it turns out they've stopped serving lunch."
    "We head back the way I came."
    "The conversation isn't as bad as I'd expect. Meiko seems to know all about the acquaintances I left behind at the old middle school we used to attend together. She remembers a lot more of them than I do."
    "But I notice she confines herself to those short years between when I left and when she must've come to Mirako."
    "I wonder..."
    "We both grew up a long ways from here. What prompted her move."
    "I do my best to ask about those half-friends I haven't thought of in years, but I'm still uneasy. Meiko's laugh seems so natural."
    "The fierce wind is welcome in the face of the midday heat. Only that purple ribbon clip of Meiko's stays fixed as her hair billows in the breeze."
    "Finally we reach the base of the hill and the town of Mirako proper."
    takeru "This is the second time walking that road this morning... Why'd they go and build a school on top of a hill?"
    meiko "You have to admit it's quite the view, though."
    takeru "True."
    "To tell the truth I've more been concentrating on avoiding any bombshells in the conversation than on admiring the scenery."
    takeru "Where's this coffee shop?"
    meiko "Just down the main road a ways."
    meiko "Mirako's a great town. You can find whatever you need if you know where to looks. Bookstores, fast food, a movie theater, good restaurants... not that I can really afford the restaurants, haha."
    meiko "It's just all a little more spread out than a big city. Do you have a bike?"
    takeru "No. I think I'd die on that road up to school."
    "She laughs again."
    meiko "Maybe, maybe. I haven't invested in one myself. Again, a little short on funds..."
    meiko "I honestly don't come into town too often. There's always so much work to do at school."
    takeru "You seem to have your fingers in a lot of pots."
    meiko "Hmm, it does look that way, doesn't it?"
    meiko "But I guess it's nice to be appreciate as a class rep, and for what I get done with the council and the other boards... You can't let anyone down."
    "She looks away. At first I wonder if she's trying to hide her expression, but instead she points out a building on the corner."
    meiko "That's the place."
    
    "It's called the \"Cat's Corner Cafe.\" The interior is small."
    "I almost expected Meiko's favorite place to be little more upscale, but I guess that'd be difficult to afford on a student's budget."
    "Business seems slow, too. A few old men reading newspapers, a young man with a laptop, a middle-aged couple grabbing a late lunch..."
    "It still doesn't feel at all like a place that'd be frequented by high school students."
    takeru "I have no idea what to order at a place like this."
    meiko "The sandwiches are pretty good. A turkey melt maybe?"
    takeru "What are you getting."
    meiko "Just a small coffee. I actually brought lunch and ate with the student council members up at Mirako..."
    takeru "Huh."
    "She blushes."
    meiko "Sorry, it'd be rude to not eat with them and I didn't want to head out early. I should've had half a meal here and half there I guess. Sorry Takeru."
    takeru "Don't worry about it. Showing me around Mirako is well, more than I deserve already."
    "Meiko mostly talks about the town while I eat."
    "It'll take some getting used to. A commute by train is more what I'm used to, but a town in the country has its own charm, I guess."
    "It seems like most of the Mirako students stick to their dorms and the few movie theaters and other entertainment spots that cater to students."
    "Is there much of a divide between the native Mirako students and those who moved here specifically for the school's specialty?"
    "When I'm done, Meiko gets a strange look on her face and asks a question I knew would come eventually."
    meiko "How was Tohoku then? You were the star of course, right?"
    takeru "Er..."
    takeru "Yeah. It was a dream come true, really."
    takeru "When I graduated from junior high, I was on the starting rotation right away."
    takeru "I guess the scouts were right. I just did my thing, and I gave even the players at the very top a run for their money. I was one of the guys pretty fast."
    takeru "Most of my classmates were pretty impressed. Pretty much everyone at school knew me, even if I didn't know them."
    takeru "There's even a good chance I would've been the starter at the championship series."
    takeru "It's funny, wasn't that I was always talking about? I was dreaming about that since I was kid."
    "It's the truth. I don't even flatter myself. I was world class, and it was the time of my life. Only in retrospect is it something I can't feel quite right about."
    meiko "I knew you had it in you. Even in middle school I could tell you were gifted."
    takeru "Thanks..."
    meiko "I'm sorry if it's personal, but, then why are you here?"
    "Time for a total fabrication. Sorry Meiko. Five years ago I could never lie to you but things are different. We're older."
    takeru "Er, I just sort of petered out. I lost a few games, and you know..."
    meiko "What?"
    takeru "They didn't want to renew my scholarship, and some other stuff came up. I sure couldn't afford that place if I wasn't on the baseball team, and the doctors and everyone sort of recommended Mirako, and..."
    takeru "Well, here I am."
    meiko "..."
    takeru "I guess it was a waste of five years, huh?"
    meiko "I wouldn't say that. You went after your dream right?"
    takeru "I guess."
    "It's painful to keep lying to her but less painful than the alternative."
    meiko "I'm glad then."
    takeru "Glad?"
    meiko "That's what I resolved to do as well."
    "Meiko keeps biting her lip. Her coffee is empty."
    meiko "You remember when I lost my parents, right?"
    takeru "We were what, nine years old? Traffic accident. I'd never forget that."
    meiko "No, you're a good person. You wouldn't."
    meiko "How did I seem then, those couple of years?"
    takeru "I guess... Lost. You wouldn't go anywhere. I had to drag you out of your aunt and uncle's hosue to even get you to study. I thought you'd get held back."
    meiko "Haha... Was I really that bad? You know you were really the only one pushing me back then."
    meiko "I didn't know what to do. I'm not a baseball star. My life was inside out and I didn't have any big dream like that. I was..."
    takeru "Aimless."
    "Current me can sympathize. Past me really didn't."
    "This whole conversation I feel like I've walked off a cliff and this is freefall. I don't want to remember this. Until now I've done a good job at locking it away."
    meiko "Right. It's only since I've come to Mirako that I've found anything like your dream."
    meiko "I'll get top marks, I'll get to a good college. From there, law school. I'm not sure if it's politics or academics after that, but..."
    "She laughs."
    meiko "I know I can do it. It's expected of me."
    takeru "You did seem really unfamiliar at first. It was a different you."
    meiko "Was it that noticeable?"
    "Like night and day."
    meiko "Maybe Mirako will help you out like that too. You can find a new dream."
    takeru "Maybe..."
    meiko "You know, you've seemed strange to me as well. Takeru, when we were kids, you were so open with me. I remember you as a very heartfelt person."
    meiko "But you're always so uneasy."
    "Was it that noticeable?"
    takeru "It's..."
    takeru "Were you really okay when I left for Tohoku?"
    "She looks away, just for a second."
    meiko "What do you mean?"
    takeru "Looks, I know we were good friends..."
    meiko "Of course. You got me through those really difficult years. You meant the world to me."
    takeru "Meiko when I got that scholarship I left without a trace. Did I even say goodbye?"
    meiko "...I don't remember."
    takeru "I got your letters."
    meiko "I wondered about that."
    "I want to say I felt guilty back then. But I didn't. There were more pressing things. It's only now that I regret anything at all."
    takeru "I'm sorry. I was practicing every day, and there were a million people who all wanted to hang out, and I could never find time."
    meiko "It's alright. You were chasing what you'd always wanted."
    meiko "I knew you got that scholarship. If I held you back, that'd make me a terrible person."
    takeru "I could've at least not just vanished."
    meiko "To tell the truth I was..."
    "She stops for a moment. Her expression freezes. I was always garbage at reading people. What's going through her mind right now?"
    "As for me, I'm just... anxious. She should be offended I even have the nerve to look at her straight."
    meiko "Glad. Sure I missed you. But I didn't want to stand in your way and if staying in touch or saying your goodbyes would've made it harder for you... Then I can't hold it against you."
    takeru "No way."
    meiko "Who knows? If you hadn't left for Tohoku, maybe I'd still be wandering around that little town looking for something to do."
    meiko "But instead I'm at Mirako, and I have a pretty good plan. That's right. A bachelor's degree from a good college, then a master's in law. No broken promises. I can do it."
    takeru "Sounds like you've made the best of things."
    meiko "That's right. In ten years I won't remember middle school or my aunt and uncle or any of that, so what does the past matter?"
    takeru "Is that really it?"
    meiko "That's it. Takeru, you don't need to feel guilty at all. I'm almost grateful. And I forgave you a long time ago."
    "I feel like I can finally breathe again."
    takeru "You don't know how much that means to me."
    "Meiko just laughs. Almost forlorn."
    takeru "I'll do my best to make it up to you."
    meiko "There's nothing to make up. Just worry about getting yourself situated at Mirako. I know it can't be easy."
    takeru "Thank you, Meiko."
    "I can say her name without wincing."
    meiko "Come on, let's head back to Mirako."
    
    "We set off for the Mirako on a different path that wraps around the other side of the hill."
    "Supposedly this is to give me a chance to appreciate the scenery of the countryside."
    "Mostly though, I can't focus on the scenery over this headache. It's not quite the same sensation as knuckles rapping against my skull, but more like against my brain."
    "There's something concussive about it."
    "Meiko and I weren't inseperable when we were growing up. We were friends, maybe even best friends, but I always had the other boys at school."
    "It's all very dim. Did she know anyone else, really? After the accident it seemed like her aunt and uncle never really liked her out of the house much."
    "Her version of our shared childhood sounds more than what I remember. It feels like my memories are being messed with and my beating head is my mental alarms going off."
    "Or I'm overthinking things again. Why would she hate me for leaving? I had a scholarship from one of the most prestigious high schools in the country. Who could blame me?"
    "Shouldn't I just accept her forgiveness and move on? Why is there part of me that pushes back?"
    "Even with the sun lowered in the sky, the heat hasn't receded and the humidity isn't helping me make sense of things."
    meiko "Here we are."
    takeru "What?"
    "She calls me over to a guardrail on the side of the road where the vegetation fades away."
    meiko "Beautiful, isn't it?"
    takeru "I... right, that sure is something."
    "Below the rail, the hill drops out into a cliff. We're at a higher elevation than I thought and I take a step back at the vertigo."
    "We're facing away from the town. Instead, there are only hills, farms, and scattered trees to the mountains in the distance."
    "Caught up in my own problems as I am, it's hard to not to appreciate the view."
    meiko "Pretty impressive, isn't it?"
    takeru "A little overwhelming actually."
    meiko "Haha, overwhelming?"
    takreu "It's been a long time since I've really been outside I guess."
    meiko "I'm sorry, that's right. I won't pry. Everyone's here for some reason I guess..."
    "Meiko frowns hard enough to scare me, but she keeps talking as if I should forget she said anything."
    meiko "But I used to be out here all the time my first year here. Just wandering around?"
    "That sounds more like the Meiko I remember."
    meiko "I'd take the long road home or just come out whenever I felt like it to catch the sunset."
    meiko "Want to stick around and watch?"
    takeru "The sunset?"
    "For today and for her absolution, I figure I owe it to her."
    takeru "Sure. I guess it shouldn't be long, right?"
    meiko "The days are getting shorter now, probably not."
    "Somewhere out in the fields a cuckoo calls."
    meiko "It almost reminds of that time we got lost on the train, remember? And we got to the park late?"
    takeru "...Not really."
    "..."
    takeru "My memory's shaky, sorry. We've got some time, so why don't you tell me?"
    meiko "Alright. It was a pretty important day for me after all."
    
    voice "We were both twelve. It was about a month after the accident. Mom and Dad were resting with my dad's side of the family, the rich ones."
    voice "They were maybe four hours away by train. Auntie sure wasn't going to take me up there. On my own I don't think I would've made the trip."
    "I vaguely remember that. There was a park she wanted to visit, desperately. Up north somewhere. It was supposed to be a mountain covered in cedars."
    "Around that time there was very little else she wanted to do."
    voice "I don't know how I got you onto that train, haha. I'm sorry if I was a little pushy."
    "..."
    "A moment of clarity in the fog."
    
    takeru "Sorry. I've got a ball game tomorrow. Shun's coming back from vacation and he hasn't played pickup in ages!"
    meiko "...oh."
    meiko "Then... are you doing anything today? This afternoon?"
    takeru "Dunno. Let me see. Mooooom!"
    "..."
    "We arrive at the train station soon after. My parents were a little trepidatious about the whole thing, but they knew Meiko's circumstances."
    "They even gave us money for the train."
    "I'm distracted, as usual."
    "Meiko probably wasn't thinking right."
    takeru "Did you see that man on the station? With the cane?"
    meiko "Sorry, I didn't."
    takeru "He was holding up the line trying to order tickets. Wonder what the cane was for? He looked like he could walk fine."
    meiko "I wonder."
    takeru "I hope I never get hurt that bad where I can't walk."
    meiko "No more baseball?"
    takeru "Exactly! And carrying a cane everywhere looks like a pain."
    "She laughs, quietly. I don't understand."
    "But as the train slows down, her expression changes."
    meiko "Takeru! We're on the wrong train! We're going backwards. What do we do?"
    takeru "We get off and turn around, silly. Come on!"
    "Before I can finish speaking, the doors slide open."
    "Is this a popular stop? I have to practically haul Meiko out before the doors close again."
    meiko "Phew!"
    takeru "Let's go! We gotta find another train or it'll be too late to do anything when we get there."
    meiko "Coming!"
    "..."
    "This far north, this hour of day, this time of the year... It's chilly outside the station."
    "The road isn't long. It's some suburb."
    "There are a few houses here that are absolutely huge. Not mansions, per se, just the ostentatiously large variety of home that the rich-but-not-mega-rich use to flaunt their wealth."
    "I gaze up at a third floor bedroom, framed against the overcast sky."
    meiko "C'mon, Takeru. What'll we do if it gets dark?"
    takeru "We're fine."
    "But I follow in silence as we come up to this park of Meiko's."
    "We pass over a foothill and the road inclines. The houses are now smaller and sparse."
    "The very last building is a shop. It doesn't look quite like junk, or even an antique store. Souveneirs maybe?"
    "There's a curve ahead."
    takeru "Just up the steps, right?"
    meiko "Yeah?"
    "It's a series of paved stairs under a sign advertising the entrance. Cedar Park and Cemetary."
    "I take the steps two at a time. Meiko trails behind."
    "At the top, the stairs open out onto a fenced terrace. Benches line a circular path in front of a grove. Beyond, just the first row of grave markers is visible."
    "I turn around. Meiko is still on her way up... I guess there were more stairs than I thought if even I'm out of breath."
    "But beyond her, the terrace overlooks the road and part of the town. It's captivating."
    meiko "I'll keep on going, I guess."
    takeru "Ah! Don't sneak up behind me."
    meiko "Sorry."
    takeru "You don't want to check out the view first? I think I can see that four story house from here."
    "Her back is already turned. There's a slump to her shoulders."
    "It would probably rude of me to follow her back to her parents' grave."
    "The benches aren't very comfortable for my wait, unfortunately."
    "Back at the fence, I think I can spot the train station from this height. And if I lean way over, I can just see the roof of the shop at the foot of the path."
    "I have nothing better to do. I take the stairs down three at a time."
    "The shop looks much less inviting from this angle. Three vintage dresses sit on display in the window."
    "I enter anyway."
    woman "Good afternoon."
    takeru "Hi."
    "After greeting the cashier, I poke around, but as I suspected, there's nothing of interest. It's mostly clothes, used books, and the odd antique piece of carpentry or farming equipment."
    woman "Can I help you with anything?"
    takeru "Nothing, thanks. Just looking. Actually..."
    "A hatbox on the counter catches my interest. It's filled with hairclips, each adorned with a different bow."
    takeru "Could I buy one of those?"
    woman "Sure. Which color?"
    takeru "Doesn't matter."
    "She seems happy for the business, and at least now I have something for Meiko."
    "As the door closes behind me, I feel the oddest sensation."
    "It's like an out of body experience."
    "..."
    voice "I cried my eyes out, of course."
    voice "And then you weren't there when I came back. I panicked for a second, but then I heard the bell on the shop door and I ran over to the fence."
    voice "You were running up the stairs of course. Two at a time."
    "I hear the jingle and the slam of the door."
    "From the top of the terrace I watch myself start up the stairs."
    "..."
    "This is going to be a cold walk back to the station. The wind is bad enough up here as is."
    "When I reach the top of steps, my breath is ragged. I almost don't notice Meiko at the top, gazing over the fence into the clouds."
    "In the direction of her gaze..."
    "There's a streak of violet in the sky as the sun goes down."
    takeru "Are you all set?"
    meiko "...I think so. Thanks for coming Takeru."
    "She sniffs."
    takeru "I got this for you. It's not much, but..."
    "I pull the clip out of the bag."
    meiko "Takeru, you shouldn't... That's too... Thanks."
    "She immediately fixes it in her hair."
    meiko "How's it look?"
    takeru "Just right."
    "It fits her like the last puzzle piece. The color suits her perfectly. It's..."
    
    menu:
        "Turquoise, just a shade lighter than her eyes":
            meiko "Thank you so much."
        
        "Pearl gray, a match to the clouds behind her":
            "She pauses."
            meiko "It's beautiful."
    
    takeru "It's just a small thing..."
    meiko "I'll treasure it."
    takeru "Right. Aren't you cold?"
    meiko "Oh... I hadn't notcied."
    "With the arrival of sundown, the purle in the sky is gone. It's just.. gray."
    takeru "Come on, let's head back to the station. We got here way too late."
    meiko "Sorry, I should've paid more attention to the train, then we'd have more time..."
    takeru "Don't worry about it. It's a story to tell right?"
    meiko "Haha."
    "Down the stairs, we walk side by side"
    "..."
    
    meiko "If I remember your parents gave you an earful for that one."
    takeru "What?"
    meiko "Are you okay Takeru? You look dizzy?"
    "Do I feel dizzy? I take a step and almost fall over the rail."
    meiko "Takeru! You're not hurt are you?"
    takeru "Sorry."
    "I stand up straight."
    takeru "It's just bad deja vu is all."
    "Like a waking dream."
    meiko "Deja vu, huh... Haha, well maybe that's because the sunset's here."
    takeru "Right."
    "It's striking. The countryside bathed in warm red radiance..."
    "I shield my eyes. Meiko stands in front of me. And I stagger again."
    "The color."
    "Wasn't it...?"
    "It was purple. That's how I recognized her two days ago. That pinkish color looks so out of place on her."
    "I gave it to her when we were kids. Of course I remember it."
    "Then why is it...?"
    takeru "We should probably head back."
    meiko "It's probably been a long day for you."
    "Not in the traditional sense. Did I misremember that one little detail? Do I have some false memory of the past three days?"
    "Schizophrenia."
    "It has to be one of those two options."
    "Either the past wasn't real or the future is fake."
    "I took my pills this morning, right?"
    meiko "You're looking really pale. You're not in great shape, are you?"
    takeru "Not really."
    takeru "Sorry if I'm being ungrateful, Meiko. It's great to see you again and I'm glad we can put what's past behind us."
    meiko "Same here. I wonder what I did to deserve this."
    "Her smile is wide."
    "We walk the rest of the length in silence."
    "Meiko seems pleased, mostly. I'm just confused."
    "Probably all that happened was I experienced too many swings today and something just... snapped. Could that be it?"
    "Should I talk to Dr. Meadow? I've been discharged. Maybe one of Mirako's specialists?"
    "What would I say? My mind's playing tricks on me? Isn't that to be expected?"
    "Not too much longer to the dorms now, and I can lie down and try to clear my head."
    "Although I doubt how much it'll help."

label day03b:
    
    "I wake up early for once, even before Kenta."
    "The room is back to its tidy self. The dressers have been moved to the center of the room and my desk migrated from my bed to the door, but Kenta's work seems to be done."
    "Last night I couldn't shake that merry-go-round of wild thoughts but this morning I feel renewed. The mental burden is gone."
    "Of course, I didn't dream. I never dream any more."
    "It's a side effect of the pills, but I'll gladly sacrifice the dreams at night to keep at bay the dreams at day."
    "Enough sitting around. I rise and yawn. Kenta's snoring so loudly I wonder if that's what woke me up in the first place."
    "The first order of business is to find where my clothes ended up."
    "At random I open a dresser!"
    takeru "Ahhhh!"
    "I stumble backwards and trip over my own bed."
    kenta "What? What?"
    takeru "Spiders! In the dresser!"
    "Clutching my pillow to my chest, I approach the open drawer."
    "A spider bigger than my fist sits motionless in the center, surrounded by hundreds of its eight-legged brethren."
    kenta "Stop! What do you think you're doing to my collection?"
    takeru "What?"
    "Kenta grabs the pillow from my and flings it back onto the bed."
    kenta "You were about to smash my Queensland whistling spider, you philistine. It's harmless. Mostly."
    "Okay. There's a pin through it and it's more like the size of my palm."
    "None of the other spiders seem to be moving at all either."
    "Dammit Kenta."
    takeru "Is this a joke? Stuffing ten million spiders into my dresser while I'm out?"
    kenta "No, I don't really see what's funny about it."
    takeru "That makes two of us."
    kenta "It's my insect collection! Spiders aren't technically insects but I figure it's a niche enough hobby that the taxonomics can be overlooked."
    kenta "This is the beetle drawer. There weren't quite enough to fill a drawer so mantises are in here too. This one's moths and butterflies..."
    takeru "Kenta."
    kenta "Sorry, do you not like insects? Here, I'll open the spider drawer back up, you seemed most interested in them."
    takeru "Kenta."
    kenta "Good morning?"
    "I can't even find the words."
    takeru "Look, nothing against spiders, but... Just... A little warning next time, okay?"
    kenta "I asked if you wanted to help moving stuff in from the shop yesterday but you seemed a little out of it."
    takeru "What happened to all the coins?"
    kenta "Had to sell them, unfortunately. They're just not very interesting. And you wouldn't believe how much they charge for those little wooden display stands."
    kenta "I still have some funds left over, but there's a trade show coming up in a month or so, so I'll need every penny."
    "Funny, I have a penny you can borrow."
    takeru "Alright, fine, you do your thing. Where can I find clothes?"
    "He takes out one article of clothing after another from the other dresser."
    takeru "How does everything even fit in there?"
    kenta "Here's your uniform. And it's a tight squeeze, even after I ironed everything."
    takeru "You... ironed?"
    kenta "Yes. It's the first off day of the month, so I did it along with the bathroom cleaning."
    "So while I wandered around Mirako, he laundered everything I own down to the last sock and also cleaned the bathroom."
    "And loaded up my dresser with venomous insects."
    takeru "Thanks?"
    kenta "You're welcome."
    takeru "We should really hurry though if you want to get to homeroom on time."
    kenta "I get it, I get it."
    
    "The walk up to Mirako is starting to seem a little less foreign. The school interior is less a maze. I find my way through the last of the morning traffic to 3B."
    "I take my seat next to an emtpy desk where Natsumi should be. Meiko isn't there either."
    "But then I spot her at the front of the room."
    meiko "...and so with the chemistry test coming up, I'm organizing a study group. If you're interested let me know after classes today and we'll find a room."
    meiko "Again, if anyone's interested in helping the student council with festival preperations, it's much appreciated."
    "She takes her seat. Somehow Natsumi snuck in while I wasn't looking."
    natsumi "A study group? You're crazy, Meiko. Don't you get perfect marks in chemistry anyway?"
    meiko "We've got to do well as a class. Other students still need help."
    natsumi "Ugh, don't rub it in."
    takeru "You said the student council needed help?"
    meiko "Oh it's nothing much. Just festival prep. I'll be taking care of most of it myself."
    natsumi "Where do you find the time for all this..."
    takeru "How much work does the student council usually do for the festival? It sounds like a big deal."
    natsumi "None of 'em work as hard as Meiko, for sure..."
    meiko "Oh don't flatter me. But yes, Takeru's it a pretty big deal -- the Mirako Cultural Festival."
    meiko "The town of Mirako itself is pretty small so there are always people coming up to enjoy themselves and see the school first-hand. It's our one chance every year to show off what we can accomplish."
    meiko "The clubs mostly organize their own events, but the student council is responsible for the school-wide stuff. And it's a week early this year, so..."
    nastumi "Oh, and the fireworks are gorgeous!"
    meiko "No fireworks this year."
    "Natsumi makes the scariest face I think I've ever seen on her."
    meiko "Anyway, most people see Mirako as this big closed-off building on a hill. We have to make a good impression. Anything less than perfect would reflect poorly on us."
    takeru "Sounds like you take this pretty seriously."
    natsumi "Yeah 'cause in the end it all reflects on her and the council as well."
    "Meiko ignores Natsumi and her grin."
    meiko "It'll be the event of the year this time around, and I'll make sure of it."
    meiko "You should join a club or something, Takeru. You'd get to participate."
    takeru "Yeah, I'll consider it..."
    
    "I'm still considering it as I drift out of the room at the lunch break."
    "Heading home early every day to deal with spiders and coins and ironed clothing just seems a little not my style."
    "Baseball is off the table. Never again."
    "Athletics in general seem dicey, really. Team sports just don't seem appropriate."
    "I wonder if Mirako even has anything close to track and field. I'm kind of amazed they even have their own baseball diamond."
    "In my wandering, I seem to have come to the old wing. I guess there's another \"club\" nearby..."
    "The supernatural does not interest me per se. Even less interesting are the books that stock the library where the pseudo-club meets. Why am I outside their door?"
    "Inside I hear voices. Two voices, actually."
    mana "It's not manga, it's a light novel!"
    hagami "A regular novel would be bad enough. If it has a number after the title, it's of no value."
    mana "Oh yeah? I seem to remember a lot of music being piano concerto number two or the ninth symphony or whatever."
    hagami "That's different."
    hagami "And what kind of sequel to a novel has a number? Is there a War and Peace 2 somewhere that I don't know about?"
    "Then laughter."
    "But... it's the laughter of two people."
    "I guess Hagami isn't a mute, she's just shy around everyone but Mana. Or maybe I'm particularly offensive."
    "At any rate, they seem happy. I won't intrude and turn lunch into another silent staring contest."
    "I turn to go, but..."
    takeru "Ow!"
    mana "Sorry sorry sorry!"
    "The door opens into me, knocking me off balance."
    mana "Oh! It's Takeru! Good afternoon! Are you alright? I didn't see you there."
    takeru "The door has a window you know..."
    mana "I know, I know..."
    mana "Did you come by to eat with us?"
    takeru "I was headed to the roof, just passing by, but..."
    "She seems more glad to see me. If I were her I think I'd find my lurking more suspicious. Maybe this isn't so bad, assuming I don't get tricked into eating with just Hagami's death glare for company."
    takeru "Are you going somewhere?"
    mana "Uhh... Let me see... Nope!"
    takeru "You just left the library for no reason?"
    mana "It must've been fate to run into you!"
    "Run into me? I dust off my shoulder. Why does fate have to be so literal?"
    mana "You're coming right?"
    takeru "Just for a bit then."
    mana "Stupendous! Okay."
    mana "Hey Hagami! You remember Takeru right?"
    hagami "...Of course."
    "She couldn't look less thrilled about."
    takeru "Sorry for the intrusion. I was just walking through."
    "I sit down and take out my food. Mana joins me, sitting opposite next to Hagami."
    mana "It's fine if you come up every day, even. I understand if you're transfer. It's fine not to have too many friends in the beginning."
    mana "When I moved here a few years back I didn't know anybody. But Hagami was so friendly."
    "It seems hard to believe. It seems Hagami agrees -- when she sees me looking at her, she shrugs."
    mana "You seem pretty friendly too though. I'm sure you're meeting lots of great people!"
    takeru "No, I have friends, I guess..."
    "Natsumi's more acquaintance than friend. Kenta could be considered a friend but at the moment I consider him a menace to my sanity. Meiko, though..."
    takeru "I actually ran into one of my best friends growing up. We lost touch a few years ago but I guess she goes here now."
    mana "Oh yeah?"
    takeru "Kotaru Meiko. She's a student council member, maybe you..."
    "From Mana's Scowl and Hagami's shake of the head, it looks like they already know her."
    takeru "Not a friend of yours, then?"
    mana "Well I dunno, she's my senior and she's always so hardworking and smart, so I guess she must be a good person, but she's also..."
    hagami "By the book."
    "By the book, coming from Hagami, wouldn't that be a good thing?"
    mana "She's not too happy about the supernatural club only having two members."
    takeru "Oh. I sort of thought the club was a joke."
    mana "It's not a joke! We do serious work here!"
    "I try to read Hagami but she has a straight face."
    takeru "Okay."
    mana "But yeah, it's nothing serious, but I guess we're not an official club really, and we don't get funding for anything..."
    takeru "What do you need funding for?"
    hagami "More books."
    "She's still stonefaced."
    mana "It'd be nice to do something for the festival..."
    takeru "Oh. That's coming up, isn't it."
    mana "Not really. Isn't it almost two months away?"
    takeru "No idea. Meiko made it sound like it was this all-consuming thing on the horizon."
    mana "Well of course! She probably has to do all the work to set it up!"
    "Is that new Meiko? Slaving over everything, setting up a dozen different events at once?"
    takeru "Anyway, I'm doing alright for myself at Mirako."
    mana "Good to hear!"
    takeru "So what exactly do you guys do at the supernatural club?"
    mana "It's all about the mysteries! Have you heard of Starset Sunrise?"
    takeru "Is that some kind of, like... astronomical thing?"
    hagami "Pffft..."
    mana "What? No. See?"
    "She shows me her paperback. It's not quite the same as the one from yesterday, but it has the same sky motif on the front cover."
    mana "I'm on volume 5 but there are 8 volumes in the arc. And if there's another run I don't know if they'll reveal the answer in the arc at all!"
    mana "It's a supernatural murder mystery, see?"
    hagami "Romance."
    mana "Well that too. But if it's a kiss with a ghost does it really count?"
    hagami "A true mystery."
    takeru "Alright, slow down. You guys just read I guess?"
    mana "I'm gonna make a mystery of my own maybe. I've got some of the illustrations done, but it's tough going. Hagami's writing."
    "Hagami's mouth is a horizontal line, but her eyes... she looks kind of alarmed."
    mana "...Maybe it's not something really worth presenting at the festival."
    takeru "Don't look so down, I'm, er, sure it's a worthwhile project."
    mana "I guess Hagami does her stuff as well."
    "Hagami declines to meet my gaze."
    mana "Show him your book."
    "She just gestures at the spine. It's something foreign. \"Confessio Fraternitatis?\""
    hagami "Rosicrucian."
    takeru "Could've fooled me, I thought it was Latin. I'm not sure I get it."
    "Hagami opens her mouth but thinks better of it. Then she whispers something to Mana."
    mana "Hagami says it's a religion thing. Or uh, not a religion. It's... eso-something? You mean a cult?"
    "Hagami gives up."
    mana "But yeah, Hagami's the best."
    mana "She's serious about this stuff. Actual mysteries from beyond! That's why she'll make the best writer."
    takeru "Right."
    "Hagami starts whispering again."
    mana "No. No. Yeah I know. No. Pleeease? Okay. No."
    mana "Scratch that. Takeru, do you know anything about the supernatural."
    takeru "Ghosts and angels and demons and stuff like that?"
    "Hagami sighs and starts in again to Mana."
    mana "Okay, so, the supernatural is really about, uh, spirits? No? Then what... Mysteries are what then? Oh leave them out of it. What?"
    mana "Hagami says the supernatural is not about demons and angels, but it's more about demons and angels than it is about romantic first kisses with ghosts."
    "Mana pouts."
    mana "If you see any angels wandering around you should totally let me know though! And I guess if you see any Rosicrucians, Hagami would be interested."
    takeru "Er..."
    mana "But if you want, Takeru, I can lend you volume one of Starset Sunrise!"
    takeru "Er, I'll have to pass for today."
    mana "Fine, fine... Hagami, do you have any book recommendations?"
    takeru "Oh, no, no thank you, I'm fine for a while thanks!"
    mana "Huh?"
    "Hagami crosses her arms."
    mana "Oh well, I guess you don't have to join..."
    mana "Four members is the minimum size for a club anyway, at least if it wants any sort of recognition. I think at two members we might get shut down..."
    mana "Not that we really had much for the festival anyway. Hagami, you weren't going to - "
    "Hagami starts vigorously shaking her head. Weren't going to what?"
    mana "Guess not. We'll just enjoy the festival with everyone else! The fireworks will be wonderful I'm sure."
    "There's another silence between Mana and Hagami, like Mana just misspoke. Half the conversation is wordless."
    "In the unease, I check my watch. Almost time to go."
    mana "Hagami, got any other projects coming up?"
    "Hagami looks at me, then back to Mana. I can't tell if she's frustrated about something from earlier or just because I happen to be here."
    mana "I was just wondering, sorry. The swim team's got an extra practice scheduled this week so I wanted to make sure I'd have time."
    "She gets the same look from Hagami. I get... not quite a glare? But Hagami seems legitimately frightened."
    mana "Sorry Hagami, isn't this what you..."
    mana "Hey Takeru, I don't..."
    takeru "I'll head out. I think it's almost time for class anyway."
    mana "Sorry! Hagami doesn't mean to be rude, it's just..."
    "Hagami stands up and I expect her to shout at me. But instead she just stares at the floor. Her hands are clenched into fists."
    "For her part, Mana just offers a weak smile."
    mana "Hope you'll come back tomorrow?"
    takeru "Yeah."
    "The door closes."
    "Hopefully she won't be expecting me just because my answer sounded vaguely affirmative."
    "Mana is alright. I can appreciate friendly people, even if they have some stranger interests. Hagami though..."
    "I can't tell if she hates me, dislikes me, or just prefers her peace and quiet. No matter which, it's nothing good."
    
    "Back in class, I get some bad news. Even though I've probably missed half the content already, I'm expected to take the upcoming chemistry test."
    "It could be worse I guess. I'll just borrow notes from Meiko or someone."
    "At the end of the day, I catch her on the way out."
    takeru "Hi Meiko."
    meiko "Oh, it's Takeru. Good afternoon."
    "She beams."
    takeru "Do you have chemistry notes from last week I could check out by any chance? You know, the week I transferred in?"
    meiko "You came to the right person. I always keep an extra set of notes in case someone's absent that day."
    meiko "But... oh, that's right, Ikeda was in the hospital that week so I'm down my copy. Do you want to come to our study group instead?"
    takeru "Study group? I guess. Is that today?"
    meiko "Tomorrow. Come find me after class."
    takeru "Right. Thanks, you've done a whole lot for me already."
    meiko "It's nothing, really."
    "I can tell she appreciates the sentiment by her smile though. At least that's what I think it is."
    takeru "You mentioned this morning that the student council was looking for volunteers."
    meiko "That's correct."
    meiko "W-Well, I don't necessarily need help per se, but I'm only one person and there's a council's worth of work to get done. It's not tough stuff, I just can't be everywhere at once."
    takeru "I'll volunteer."
    meiko "Are you sure?"
    "Her face is blank. I kind of thought she'd be glad about this."
    takeru "I just thought..."
    takeru "Look, I owe you a lot, not just for helping me around Mirako. I don't exactly have a clean conscience about five years ago when - "
    meiko "Don't - "
    "She closes her eyes, then returns to her usual smiling, serence self."
    meiko "You don't owe me anything Takeru. But I'd be glad for any kind of assistance with the festival work. It'd be rude of me to decline, especially after I asked..."
    meiko "Ah, it's so painful to ask in the first place..."
    meiko "But thank you. That would be much appreciated."
    takeru "What can I do for you then?"
    meiko "Come find me tomorrow. We have a bunch of applications that need corrections before we can use them on the programs."
    takeru "Okay. I'll see what I can do."
    meiko "Thanks Takeru! You're the best."
    "I'm far from it. But I'm not so terrible that I can just let my past mistakes slide."
    "I want to say I'm not a coward in that way... but I am. There are still things I can't face."
    
    "Outside, the crowd has thinned out a bit. There's a cool breeze that offers some relief from the day, and several students are sitting around working on the outdoor tables."
    "Meiko of course had one of her many meetings to attend and won't be headed home right away."
    "I suppose Kenta has already started home."
    "There's something on the edge of my vision... I least I hope it's there in reality."
    "It's... a finger?"
    takeru "Kenta! Don't sneak up on people."
    kenta "Hello Takeru."
    takeru "You can actually tap my shoulder, you know. That's fine."
    kenta "I wouldn't want to be rude."
    "That sounds accusatory."
    "Oh, right."
    takeru "Hello Kenta. You are allowed to tap on my shoulder, you don't have to ghost tap it. How am I supposed to notice that?"
    kenta "I'm not sure. How should I get your attention then?"
    takeru "My name works. Since when have you been shy about this? How long ago was it you woke me up by pounding on my forehead."
    kenta "Sorry?"
    takeru "Never mind, never mind... Are you headed back?"
    kenta "I'm headed into town today."
    takeru "Oh, right. The hobby shop?"
    "My heart sinks a bit. I forgot about that obligation."
    kenta "Hobby shop? Why would I go there?"
    kenta "I'm headed to the hardware store. It's incredibly difficult to adjust display stands without needle-nosed pliers."
    takeru "I'm sure it is."
    kenta "It is."
    takeru "Well, enjoy yourself."
    kenta "Goodbye."
    "He sets off down the road."
    "Should I do the same? I feel like another day cooped up in the dorm wouldn't do me any wonders."
    "Plus the thought of all those dead bugs hanging out in the dresser keeping me company doesn't sound all that great."
    "Maybe I'll get started studying..."
    "I was never an academic powerhouse at Tohoku but there was really no one who expected it of me. Now that I'm just an ordinary person, it wouldn't do me any favors to start failing tests."
    "Not that the prospect of reading through some textbook sounds appealing, even outside in this ideal weather."
    "I head back inside."
    
    "I originally intended to head back to the classroom or to find the main library or somewhere else nondescript to work."
    "Instead, I now find myself in the unused wing."
    "The door to the old library is open and the room is empty. The radio is missing from the central table."
    "Even though no one's there, I feel like if I'm in this room I should either be reading about alchemy as opposed to chemistry. Instead I head downstairs."
    "That's right. There was another unusual room down here."
    "And..."
    "What was her name?"
    "It doesn't take too long to locate the tea room. All the other classrooms down here are disused, abandoned, and devoid of any furnishing but a layer of dust."
    "All the other rooms have their curtains open though. This one doesn't."
    takeru "Anyone home?"
    "No reply."
    "I barely avoid killing myself on the low table and open the windows."
    "Whatever her name was, she's not here."
    "I set my things on the floor and pull out my textbook. My bookbag has sadly gained weight over the past few days. I'm still a new student here, but the emphasis is on \"student\" now."
    "The stuff is incomprehensible though. I might as well be reading Hagami's thesis on meta-metaphysics."
    "This old-fashioned room doesn't help my concetrantion though."
    "Why did I come down her? Did I expect to find someone here?"
    "Without any reason to it, I prepare myself a cup of tea."
    "Too hot. This room might be fine in the winter, but it's still too summerlike out for this to comfortable with a hot beverage. I leave the teacup on the tabletop to walk to the window."
    "It opens, thankfully. The breeze is a welcome improvement. The view off to the side of Mirako's hill isn't all that bad either."
    "I could see getting used to this place."
    "Maybe that's why she was always down here."
    "Who again?"
    takeru "Hikari."
    "I mumble her name. That was it, right?"
    hikari "Hello."
    takeru "Ah! What the - "
    takeru "When did you get here?"
    hikari "I just came in. Did you say my name?"
    takeru "No. I mean, yes, I did, but..."
    "She smirks."
    takeru "What are you doing here?"
    hikari "It's my room, after all, but I'll forgive your rudeness. You... So you did say my name."
    takeru "Hikari. I mean it's a nice name and all, I guess I just don't understand the importance."
    hikari "There are a lot of things I don't understand."
    "Hikari takes a seat at the table. In front of my tea."
    takeru "Classes are over. Aren't you headed home?"
    hikari "If I was in class, I would never get to spend time in here, would I?"
    takeru "I don't know. I was under the impression you never left."
    hikari "Like a shutin?"
    takeru "I guess."
    "I laugh. I'm not really sure why she strikes me as so strange. In the afternoon light, she still looks two shades paler than the faded falls, but there's some color to her cheeks."
    hikari "So you're a student here. That's right."
    takeru "Yeah."
    hikari "I'm sorry, I forgot your name. Could you remind me?"
    takeru "Is that a joke?"
    hikari "No. I sincerely apologize."
    "I take my seat in front of the textbook."
    takeru "Takeru. I'm a transfer, remember?"
    hikari "That's right. I'll never forget you, okay?"
    takeru "Okay?"
    hikari "So don't forget about me."
    "This all seems very heartfelt... so why does she speak with such a monotone?"
    takeru "Okay."
    takeru "...You seem awfully interested in that tea."
    hikari "It's... nothing."
    "Her nose twitches. It's a funny gesture on Hikari's otherwise stoic face."
    hikari "Are you studying?"
    takeru "I have no nothing better to do. Sorry if I crashed your room. This seems to be happening a lot lately. I'll head out if you like."
    hikari "That's fine. You should stay."
    takeru "Alright."
    hikari "...You said you're a student, right?"
    "I really don't understand her. Didn't we go over this?"
    takeru "That isn't a problem, is it?"
    hikari "D-do you mind... telling me how things are?"
    takeru "What do you mean?"
    hikari "Just... What's going on? What are classes like? You know lots of people, right?"
    takeru "Sorry, I've only been here a couple days now."
    hikari "Oh..."
    "In that moment she seems very distant."
    takeru "I mean... I guess it's a productive atmosphere? I don't know. I can't really read the mood of the whole school. Everyone's looking forward to the festival I guess."
    takeru "Apart from that, you probably know better than me. You've been here... at least since the beginning of the year, right?"
    "Hikari is silent again."
    hikari "This will be my third year here."
    takeru "Ah, so you're the same year as me."
    hikari "...I just don't know many people."
    "I look around this cluttered room. I can imagine. Anyone spending time down here would be considered a recluse."
    hikari "Have you ever had something happen to you, something so significant, that afterwards, you just couldn't connect with people the same way as before?"
    takeru "That's a pretty good summary of my life at this point."
    hikari "Maybe you can relate then, but..."
    hikari "I'm sorry, this is all very abrupt and you hardly know me. I'm sure this is a little creepy."
    "I honestly find her strange manners more creepy than what she's saying. Her hands remain in her lap and her gaze seems to be fixed straight ahead, somewhere behind me."
    takeru "No, I'm not weirded out, if that's what you're asking."
    hikari "If you're a transfer I guess that means you weren't here last year."
    takeru "Right."
    hikari "..."
    "She's now staring at my untouched tea again, on the table in front of her."
    takeru "Help yourself if you want. It's probably cooled off by now."
    hikari "...What? Oh. Was I that obvious?"
    takeru "Well you've either been staring at the tea or out the window for the past half hour."
    hikari "Sorry, I must seem terribly odd."
    takeru "Trust me I've met stranger people the past few days."
    "Hikari seems to be alright with that answer. She remains seated with that awkward posture though."
    "I read a page or two from the textbook but it's hard to concentrate with her in the room, sitting there motionless."
    "It's hard to tell if she's intruding in my space or I've wandered into hers. Probably the latter."
    takeru "What exactly do you do in here?"
    hikari "I read sometimes. I enjoy chess. Tea is nice. And when I can manage it, the window is..."
    "She trails off. That's an odd collection of hobbies."
    takeru "Oh. Well, I didn't mean to spook you by wandering in here. I was honestly just looking for the library."
    hikari "It's just upstairs."
    takeru "Isn't that the old library though?"
    hikari "...I guess."
    hikari "The real library would be, let's see..."
    "She describes how to get there, but I realize I've actually walked past it several times already."
    "What's stranger is watching her how to describe how to get somewhere without using any hand gestures. She uses no body language."
    takeru "Thanks... I should get going then."
    hikari "Really?"
    takeru "This is obviously your space, so..."
    hikari "What's my name?"
    takeru "Hikari. What?"
    hikari "That must've seemed very strange. Forget I said that. It wasn't anything."
    takeru "Right?"
    hikari "You should stay, Takeru. You haven't finished your tea."
    takeru "I don't know why I made that. It's pretty much still summer out there."
    hikari "The smell of tea is invigorating. It's a memory aid and it should help you study better."
    hikari "...I can help you study, you know."
    takeru "Oh yeah? You're a chemistry expert?"
    hikari "Here. Let me see the book."
    takeru "It's all yours."
    "I push it over to her and take my tea in return. Hikari makes no effort to reposition the book and simply stares down at it."
    hikari "I'll read the chemical symbol. You answer. I'll tell you if you're wrong."
    takeru "A quiz already...? Right, okay. What's first?"
    "My performance is pretty poor, considering I never went over this stuff in the first place and my studying here amounted to all of five minutes."
    "In all likelihood it would be more effective for me to just read the book myself instead of having Hikari practically read it out loud to me."
    "Her face and her steady voice don't betray any hint that she's getting anything out of this, but I must imagine she takes some pride in it if she's willing to keep it up."
    "All in all, I guess it's better than nothing."
    takeru "Thanks Hikari, that was helpful."
    "At the mention or her name she turns her head a bit."
    hikari "My pleasure. But you're going to need to work a bit harder if you want to pass this class."
    takeru "Isn't that why I'm studying? Right, I'll keep it up though."
    takeru "See you later."
    hikari "Goodbye."
    "She stands in the doorway and offers an awkward wave."
    "Mirako has its share of odd people."
    "At least everyone's friendly enough."
    "I was suspecting revulsion or suspicion. At least from the average kids from town. Maybe my particular quirks aren't showing as strong as I think."
    "But then again, maybe revulsion and suspicion is more what I expected from myself. If you had shown me these people six months ago, or even introduced me to myself..."
    "I wonder if I would be so sympathetic?"
    "And so I find it difficult to judge anyone too harshly."

label day04:

    "I wake up to a sharp rap on the forehead."
    kenta "Hello. We're behind schedule."
    takeru "I'm awake, I'm awake!"
    "Beats waking up to spiders, I guess."
    "I navigate Kenta's organizational systems and, prep for school, and fly through the morning routine. Almost out the door, and -"
    takeru "Wait a second."
    kenta "We'll be late."
    takeru "Kenta, hold on, we've got plenty of time."
    "I almost forgot my pills."
    "Two every morning. It's a small price to pay for \"never again.\""
    "Granted on Sunday they didn't exactly do their job. At least I don't think."
    "But I'll be far worse without them. I remember a few of those nights in the ward."
    "Kenta is waiting outside, his eyes fixed on his wrist where a watch would go."
    kenta "Are you ready to go?"
    takeru "Yeah, let's head out."
    
    "The beginning of the day passes as usual."
    "Natsumi arrives in the nick of time. Meiko has some remarks for the class (does she seriously do this every day?)"
    "Only after the end of the first class does it feel like things ever slow down this morning."
    meiko "Natsumi, wake up. If you zone out during class I'm not giving you my notes."
    natsumi "Yeah you will... You're too nice."
    meiko "I can be strict if I want. Why are you so tired anyway?"
    natsumi "Regionals are coming up. I run practices a bit longer before big tournaments."
    takeru "Sounds rough."
    meiko "What, Takeru, isn't that normal? I remember you always wearing out your arm before a big game."
    natsumi "Oh yeah, you play baseball after all?"
    "I try to signal to Meiko. I think she catches what I mean by the look in my eye, but..."
    meiko "Takeru is quite talented. His pitching even got him a scholar - "
    takeru "No, I don't play baseball."
    "Natsumi looks more confused than Meiko. Can I really hide this any longer? Is it worth trying? This can only open up awkward questions that I'm in no shape to answer."
    meiko "Takeru, don't you - "
    takeru "I don't play any more."
    natsumi "Wait."
    "An insidious smile takes over Natsumi's face and she jabs a finger at my chest."
    natsumi "You said you transferred from Tohoku, right?"
    takeru "I don't remember saying that..."
    meiko "He did."
    natsumi "You're telling me you got scouted by Tohoku? And they offered to have you come play?"
    takeru "They were optimistic. I got there and I played like garbage."
    meiko "Oh..."
    takeru "Why else would I be here and not there?"
    natsumi "Dunno. I kind of assumed you had, y'know..."
    takeru "Mental problems? Thanks."
    natsumi "Not that there's anything wrong with that! Mirako's a great place, you know."
    natsumi "You were what, a pitcher? What's your top MPH?"
    takeru "Zero MPH."
    natsumi "Oh come on... This could be a big thing."
    "I would've thought she'd be able to figure out by now I'm not comfortable with this. For her part, Meiko just watches."
    "Slowly though, Natsumi slides back in her chair."
    natsumi "Fine, fine..."
    "She's still giving me a look though. Sort of a side-eye stare."
    meiko "I take you haven't joined the baseball team then."
    takeru "No. I'm retired. I'd rather not bring it up."
    meiko "Sorry if I inconvenienced you."
    takeru "No, no, I shouldn't be so touchy about it. You were just trying to be helpful."
    natsumi "..."
    "Please stop looking at me like that Natsumi."
    takeru "I haven't joined anything yet and I probably won't for a while."
    meiko "That's a shame. Why not?"
    takeru "I'm still just trying to get used to Mirako. I don't think I need any other distractions."
    meiko "Sometimes distractions are all we've got."
    takeru "Not ones with bad associations."
    meiko "Bad associations..."
    meiko "Well, you adapt however you need to, and let me know if I can help. Just remember I've always got your back, Takeru."
    "Meiko beams."
    natsumi "Cuuute."
    takeru "Oh be quiet."
    "I get the feeling there's a conspiracy here, and I'm not really looking forward to where it leads."
    "But maybe Meiko is right and what I need is a distraction."
    
    "That's still what's on my mind as I leave the classroom for lunch."
    "Should I head up to the old library? Probably not. After that awkward exit yesterday my bet is Hagami would prefer if I weren't constantly hanging around. Probably Mana too."
    kenta "Hello Takeru."
    takeru "Ah, hey Kenta. Are you headed somewhere for lunch?"
    kenta "Possibly."
    "I still haven't actually grabbed lunch with this guy."
    takeru "Maybe we could..."
    kenta "...Could what? It's rude to end your sentences in the middle you know. It can make people very confused."
    "There's someone over his shoulder. Staring at me."
    hagami "..."
    takeru "Hi Hagami?"
    kenta "Are you talking to me? Did you call me something? You're very strange today."
    "I gesture for him to turn around."
    kenta "Oh, it's you. Hello. I forget your name again. Sorry. I'm Kenta."
    hagami "..."
    kenta "That's very rude, you know. I'm introducing myself. I think you reply with your name."
    hagami "..."
    "Hagami looks like she's concentrating. Her gaze narrows into a glare. Is she sweating? Should I interrupt?"
    hagami "...Hagami."
    kenta "Could you speak up?"
    takeru "She said her name's Hagami."
    kenta "Takeru it's impolite to speak for other people. Why doesn't she talk? Did I snub her or something?"
    takeru "Leave her alone Kenta. Hagami, is there something you needed?"
    "Hagami looks at me, then at Kenta. She's not glaring any more. Actually, as I watch, her eyes open in... fear?"
    "She turns around and walks down the hall."
    kenta "She's always like that."
    takeru "You know her?"
    kenta "She's in my class. Not that she ever talks to me, or to half of the teachers. Some people just have very poor manners."
    kenta "I've heard her speak though, so I don't understand why she can't give me the same courtesy."
    takeru "I guess..."
    kenta "Goodbye."
    takeru "That was abrupt. Is there somewhere you need to..."
    "But then I see the reason why."
    natsumi "Heya."
    "Natsumi has wandered over. Some of her usual group of friends is wandering around as well."
    "I almost feel like I've been cornered by a gang and about to be mugged."
    takeru "Oh. Hey. Sorry if I snapped at you in class. I didn't mean to... I guess it was just sudden. But I'm not up for talking baseball."
    natsumi "No worries."
    "She's got that smile again though."
    natsumi "I heard from a certain someone you're staying late to study for chem, right?"
    takeru "Maybe."
    natsumi "We're study buddies. I'm calling it now."
    takeru "What's that supposed to mean?"
    natsumi "It means you better know your chemistry, Takeru."
    takeru "Wait, I wasn't even in class when you covered half this stuff, how am I supposed to - "
    natsumi "See ya!"
    "She waves and walks down the hall to rejoin her group. That guy in the baseball cap gives me a wave."
    takeru "...You're a strange one."
    "Now just to figure out what I'm going to do for lunch..."
    "If Hagami and Natsumi hadn't scared off Kenta, maybe I'd still be able to find him. What's his deal with Natusmi anyway?"
    "I start down the hall in the vague direction Kenta went. Even if I don't run into anybody, it beats eating lunch at my desk."
    "There's Kenta. His height makes him easy to spot at a distance. Is he... arguing with someone?"
    "He seems to be cowering from whoever's talking at him. They're a good head shorter than him, whoever they are. Wait, is that...?"
    mana "I don't care what's polite or not! You can't just say that to people! Do you know how she felt? Why don't you try walking in her shoes for a second?"
    kenta "How would I know how she felt? I'm not psychic. Who are you, anyway?"
    takeru "Hi Mana, Kenta. What on earth is going on?"
    mana "You know this jerk?"
    takeru "That jerk's my roommate."
    kenta "I still don't understand why I'm a jerk here. Takeru, I'm not that bad, am I?"
    takeru "Someone please just explain to me what's going on."
    mana "This guy was mean to Hikari! He started bullying her when she wouldn't speak up."
    kenta "I don't understand. I'll go apologize to her now, if that's what you want."
    mana "No no no! Don't go find her, that'll make things worse!"
    kenta "Then what do you want from me?"
    mana "Just apologize to me!"
    kenta "I don't know your name, how am I supposed to do that?"
    takeru "Alright, okay, I think I get this."
    kenta "Then can you explain to me what exactly - "
    takeru "I've got it from here Kenta. Let's go, Mana."
    kenta "Goodbye."
    "Kenta just stands there in the middle of the hall as I escort up Mana up the stairs. Dumbstruck?"
    "She keeps waving her hands around all over the place as we walk."
    mana "...and how do you even stand rooming with him? Boneheads like that are why Hagami feels that way in the first place! I swear if I could..."
    "We arrive at the roof."
    "Mana finally exhausts herself. She flops on the railing and we watch the students milling about down below."
    mana "Phew."
    takeru "This is about earlier during lunch, right? I was with Kenta and Hagami showed up. I didn't know what she wanted."
    mana "Yeah. Well... Okay, this is complicated."
    takeru "Kenta's not so bad. I think he's legitimately confused."
    mana "No one should get angry just because Hagami won't speak up! This is Mirako! People are supposed to be accepting of one another. Doesn't he get that?"
    takeru "He thinks everyone should speak their mind and that should be that."
    mana "Then why did he get so upset when I spoke my mind? Ugh... My head hurts. I'm too hungry for this."
    mana "You'll join us for lunch then, right?"
    "I'm in this one for the duration, I guess. Although considering Kenta's choices in hobbies I'm not sure how much effort I'll expend backing him up..."
    "He's lucky I don't have a spider phobia."
    "The old library isn't far off. Mana announces our arrival."
    mana "Hagami! You're back, right?"
    hagami "Yeah, I was waiting. You didn't - "
    "Her mouth clamps shut when she sees me."
    takeru "...Hi."
    "I feel terrible being dragged into this situation constantly. It's clear Hagami prefers I weren't around but is Mana just oblivious?"
    "She seems pretty in tune with her friend's feelings, so then why do I always end up here?"
    hagami "...Hello."
    mana "Good work Hagami."
    "Mana pats Hagami on the back."
    mana "Takeru, aren't you going to sit down?"
    takeru "Oh. I guess."
    "I take a seat next to Mana."
    mana "I gave that guy the treatment. The full works. When anyone ever acts like that, you come to me, okay?"
    hagami "I..."
    hagami "Doesn't..."
    "Hagami pulls her gaze away from me and onto Mana."
    hagami "Doesn't that defeat the point?"
    mana "Well... Maybe? I don't know. I'm sorry Hagami, I'm just trying to help."
    takeru "Sorry if I shouldn't ask, but, the point of what?"
    "It was a question directed at Hagami, really, but I'm not surprised when Mana answers."
    mana "Hagami and I are trying some things out. We've been best friends ever since I started here, but she's graduating soon, and for the festival, it's..."
    "She trails off when Hagami starts whispering in her ear."
    mana "Alright. Alright. Hagami says that it's nothing important. But Hagami is going to try to express herself a little bit more."
    "Hagami elbows Mana. Somehow I imagine that's not exactly what she said."
    takeru "I guess I should apologize for Kenta. He's a good guy, I think. He's my roommate, actually, Hagami, if you didn't know."
    hagami "...No."
    takeru "I think he's pretty considerate. Well, maybe not considerate, but he doesn't mean any harm. And he was just trying to be helpful. He was just encouraging you to speak up."
    hagami "...I know."
    takeru "Then why did Mana - "
    mana "Sorry, Hagami, I'm really sorry, it's just reflex by now, I'm sure you didn't want me to..."
    mana "Takeru, I know you haven't known us very long but I think we owe you an explanation anyway."
    mana "It's not that Hagami's that shy or anything, and she's not a mute, she just - "
    "Mana takes another elbow in the gut from Hagami. Then the whispers begin."
    mana "Hagami is... Um... Hagami is a hundred percent normal, and uh... Wait. Well if you want to do it then just do it! Uh... No, well, yeah I was trying to help you out, but... Yeah..."
    hagami "It's... a phobia."
    takeru "What?"
    hagami "Men. I cannot deal with men. It.. I... It's irrational, I know, but..."
    hagami "Go ahead, Mana."
    mana "Takeru, do you know what androphobia is?"
    takeru "Sounds Latin."
    mana "It's fear of men. It means - "
    "Hagami practically has her face buried in her hands now. Mana takes notice."
    mana "Look, I don't know what you want me to say, Hagami. Isn't this what you wanted?"
    "Hagami looks back up. Her face is burning, but she looks straight at me this time. It's the only time I can recall her looking me in the eyes."
    mana "Hagami wants to improve. Not being able to talk to half of everyone isn't just inconvenient, it means she... She has to rely on me."
    mana "We're gonna be split up next year, so... Hagami wants to face her fears."
    hagami "Mana, that's... please, less melodrama."
    hagami "Takeru, sorry to pull you into this mess. I..."
    "Her face contorts. She keeps mouthing words, but then gives in and talks into Mana's ear."
    mana "Hagami went downstairs to find you and see if you wanted to eat up here with us."
    mana "I know we must seem like the two weirdest people in the school right now, but..."
    mana "Look, Hagami's the most talented person I know! The smartest, too! She's my best friend and I wouldn't trade anything for that. So you've got to help her out, okay?"
    takeru "Er, I'll try, but, what do you mean?"
    "Hagami's blush shows no signs of fading as Mana continues on."
    mana "Just stick with us. Be patient and don't run away or harass Hagami for being quiet or anything. I don't know if there's anything I could do in return, but this means a lot to Hagami, so it means a lot to me."
    hagami "Mana, please..."
    "To me she looks more embarassed than fearful."
    mana "It's a lot to ask, I know, and you probably want to go have lunch with normal people or spend time with that Meiko girl or people, but..."
    mana "W-why are you laughing?"
    "Am I? I guess I am. Is this like the insanity defense?"
    takeru "That's not... You're asking me to eat lunch like it's some favor."
    takeru "Look Mana, I don't mind coming up here every day. It's not like anyone else is begging to spend lunch period with me. I'm pretty much friendless."
    takeru "I was mostly worried I was intruding."
    mana "Intrude? You could never intrude! Didn't I invite you to come any time?"
    takeru "I guess, but I mean... Hagami it was pretty clear you didn't want me around."
    "Hagmai glares at me. Well, she glares at somewhere over my shoulder."
    takeru "Not like it's anything against you, I was just..."
    hagami "Uncomfortable."
    takeru "Right."
    hagami "That... That makes two of us."
    mana "Great!"
    takeru "How is that great?"
    mana "Uhhh..."
    "For a moment, no one speaks. We all look anywhere but each other."
    takeru "I'll try and show up here for lunch most days, okay?"
    takeru "Let's just... talk about something else."
    "Hagami's face drops one intensity of red. I guess she agrees."
    mana "Hmm, let's see..."
    mana "Oh! Hey! Takeru, you wouldn't know anything about ghost-hunting would you?"
    takeru "Ghost hunting? Like with a vacuum cleaner or something?"
    mana "Yeah! Or with an oujia board!"
    "Hagami immediately leans in to whisper in Mana's ear."
    mana "..."
    mana "I'm told you're supposed to use salt."
    mana "Hagami that's a lot less interesting."
    "Hagami crosses her arms."
    takeru "What are you talking about again though? A ghost hunt?"
    hagami "It's not... a hunt. It's..."
    mana "We're gonna try out some of the Rosicruciwhatsit from Hagami's books. Maybe we'll find some ghosts. Maybe we won't. Maybe ghosts will send us some messages from beyond! Wouldn't that be fun?"
    takeru "Messages from beyond... Like angels?"
    hagami "Those aren't real."
    "Okay, but ghosts are?\""
    mana "I'm not sure I really get most of this stuff, but Hagami said it shouldn't be too hard. We just need some candles, at least a bit of silver to use with the runes, and uh... What else?"
    takeru "I might be in a bit over my head here. I wasn't really expecting to have to deal with runes during lunch break."
    hagami "This..."
    "She whispers to Mana, but Mana just frowns."
    mana "You tell him that then."
    hagami "This..."
    hagami "It'll take a bit. A few days."
    takeru "Oh."
    mana "I'm kind of disappointed as well. I was really looking forward to contacting some ghosts!"
    "I notice she's looking down at that paperback she's always carrying around. Hagami laughs. Did she notice the same thing?"
    hagami "Stop reading those ghost boyfriend books."
    mana "Oh shut up."
    mana "Takeru, we're probably going to get started tonight. You're in, right?"
    takeru "Sorry, I've got a test coming up. I wasn't around last week so I'm meeting some classmates to study tonight."
    mana "Oh..."
    mana "Maybe tomorrow afternoon?"
    hagami "It's not... It's not that important."
    takeru "Er, maybe, I guess."
    mana "You're not a member of the supernatural club, that's right after all. We're a pretty strange club anyway!"
    "I won't argue that one."
    mana "You'll still show up for lunch right?"
    takeru "Yeah. Thanks for having me."
    mana "Any time! I know it's rough not knowing anyone."
    "Hagami nods."
    takeru "I guess it's almost time for class... I should get going."
    mana "Me too! Alright, have a good day Takeru. See you tomorrow!"
    hagami "...See you."
    "After some hesitation, Hagami waves as I walk out the door. Mana laughs beside her."
    
    "Class drags on."
    "Now that everything doesn't feel quite so new, I finally notice how humid this rooms can be."
    "It takes most of my force of will to pay attention at all. While I'm not a bad student per se, I can longer coast along on middling grades and count on my other talents to bail me out."
    "And as a result I'll have to attend this study session thing with Meiko and the rest of them."
    "After the lesson, though, Natsumi retreats into conversation with several surrounding students. I hardly know their names."
    "Meiko also shows no signs of hurrying off."
    takeru "Hey Meiko... Wasn't there supposed to be some sort of group study thing this afternoon?"
    meiko "Yes. I'm glad you're coming Takeru."
    "Her smile is radiant. For once it doesn't make me uncomfortable."
    meiko "We'll probably meet up in half an hour or so. I've got pick up some papers from the student council."
    takeru "Right."
    meiko "I look forward to seeing you there."
    "She turns with a flourish and exits stage right."
    "I'm left to my own devices, I guess."
    "The halls is filled with students heading to practices, leaving for hom, or just on their way to idle in the courtyard."
    "I stand and watch from the great glass windows the comprise Mirako's exterior."
    "There are one or two familiar faces in the crowd. Someone from class says hello."
    "In some ways I'm feeling less like a transfer student and more like just a student student, but still... if that were the case, would I really be standing here, looking out a window?"
    "Eventually, traffic thins."
    "In fact, there's nobody here in the entire length of the hallway."
    "Then why do I hear... three soft footsteps?"
    hikari "Takeru."
    takeru "Ahh! You scared the hell out of me Hikari."
    "I notice a glimmer in her eye as she hears her name."
    takeru "What are you doing here?"
    hikari "I go to school here, right? I'm allowed to leave the old wing, you know."
    takeru "Right. I guess I just never saw you anywhere else so I figured you were... I don't know."
    hikari "You think I'm strange?"
    takeru "Yeah."
    "Whoops."
    takeru "I mean, everyone's strange and I'd be surprised if anybody thought I was normal at this point. But that's part of Mirako's mission, right?"
    hikari "Well put."
    takeru "Er, it was mostly rambling. I'm sorry if I offended you."
    hikari "No, that's fine. I'm just glad you have some opinion about me, no matter what it is."
    takeru "Do people ignore you often?"
    hikari "Sometimes. But usually they just... forget that I'm there."
    hikari "Forget I said that."
    hikari "Anyway, I was wondering what you were up to. You weren't finished studying for that test, right?"
    takeru "No, actually, I - "
    hikari "Then do you want to come back to the tea room? I can help you again."
    "This is awkward."
    takeru "Er, I was actually about to meet up with some friends to go over the practice problems."
    takeru "Thanks for helping me out yesterday though."
    hikari "It was my pleasure."
    natsumi "Heya Takeru!"
    takeru "Ah!"
    "Someone sneaks up on me for the second time today."
    natsumi "Weren't you coming to the library? Meiko's gonan be disappointed."
    natsumi "Or... hello?"
    hikari "..."
    "It's strange. Hikari doesn't even look at Natsumi. In fact, she's making eye contact with me."
    "Slowly, slowly, in that twitchy fashion of hers, she faces Natsumi."
    hikari "Hello."
    natsumi "Sorry, have we met? You look familiar, but..."
    natsumi "Well, I'm Natsumi, but you must already know that."
    "Natsumi pauses. If she's waiting for Hikari to respond, that doesn't seem likely."
    hikari "I'm called Hikari."
    hikari "I'm sure that doesn't mean anything to you, but..."
    "Hikari glances at me."
    hikari "Maybe we'll see more of each other in the coming days."
    natsumi "Uhh, okay. Well nice to meet you. You're a friend of Takeru? Don't tell me you've got another middle school friend you're running around with, Takeru."
    hikari "No."
    natsumi "Hum."
    hikari "..."
    takeru "Just an acquaintance."
    hikari "I know who you are, Natsumi. We've met."
    natsumi "Hmmm, well I knew your face looked familiar at least."
    hikari "Of course."
    natsumi "Umm..."
    hikari "..."
    natsumi "Alright Takeru! See you in a bit, study buddy. Don't forget!"
    takeru "Got it."
    takeru "What was with that, Hikari?"
    hikari "Was that unusual?"
    takeru "Yeah. Natsumi's a friendly person. She was friendly with me as soon as she met me. You don't have a grudge against her or anything?"
    hikari "If that was unusual, then... forget it happened."
    hikari "No, I don't hold grudges, really. They aren't very relevant. But neither is Natsumi a relevant person, probably."
    takeru "Relevant?"
    hikari "She won't affect things one way or the other. She's just another person whose existence just trickles by."
    "Hikari's staring out the glass now at the afternoon sun."
    takeru "That's a little morbid."
    hikari "Maybe I'm a bit of a morbid person."
    takeru "Am I a relevant person then?"
    hikari "The first I've met in a while. I sure hope you'll stay that way..."
    hikari "Maybe I was harsh to Natsumi. Could you apologize to her?"
    takeru "I don't think you said anything that bad, but sure, I'll let her know."
    hikari "Thank you. Shouldn't you be leaving to join your friends?"
    takeru "I guess."
    "There's something sad in her voice though."
    "I don't think it has anything to do with me, though. Hikari sounded like she was talking past me."
    hikari "Maybe I'll see you tomorrow. Goodbye."
    "She leaves down the hall, one footstep at a time. There is no echo."
    "I watch her back for a few moments."
    "Why do her mannerisms strike me as so odd? Even her walking seems forced."
    "And it's not like Natsumi to forget a name, either... She even remembered Kenta, when he had no idea who she was."
    "Then again, I get the idea that Kenta has no idea who a lot of people are."
    "And it's kind of hard to forget Kenta."
    "Anyway, I have a study group to find. Now to the library."
    
    natsumi "Took you long enough."
    takeru "Oh come on, it wasn't that long."
    natsumi "Meiko's already getting started. Shhh."
    "True to form, Meiko has the textbook out and is copying a diagram to the whiteboard. Looks like the rest of us will be trying to follow her lesson."
    "The space is very comfortable, though."
    "It seems that the library was remodeling along with the building exterior, and the whole thing is very modern."
    "Shelves stand at regular intervals in the main hall, but we all sit around a table in a side room."
    "A single transparent pane separates us from the rest of the library. Inside, there's enough room to comfortably seat a dozen."
    meiko "...but the problems on the test will probably combine most of these elements, so make sure you're comfortable with each individual practice problem before..."
    "Natsumi sits in rapt attention."
    "Why did Meiko sign up for this? It looks like she has nothing less than perfect mastery already."
    natsumi "She's pretty good, huh?"
    takeru "Yeah."
    takeru "Does she organize stuff like this often?"
    natsumi "It's rude to whisper when someone else is talking."
    takeru "You started it."
    natsumi "But yes."
    "Natsumi recrosses her arms and refocuses on Meiko."
    "It looks the plan is to do some practice problems in pairs and then check each other's work."
    "The mini-lecture finally comes to a close and Meiko catches her breath before sitting down next to me."
    meiko "Phew."
    natsumi "That was great, Meiko!"
    takeru "You're really good at this."
    meiko "Haha, I put in a lot of work... Glad you appreciated it."
    "She throws me a look. I don't quite understand the meaning."
    takeru "Should we get started in on the problems then?"
    natsumi "That's the plan, study buddy!"
    "..."
    "I'm pretty poor at this though. Even Meiko's brief lesson was more intended to be a refresher and doesn't much help when I was never taught this originally."
    "It's like I have to work from scratch."
    "Natsumi make some clumsy attempts to help but she's no expert either."
    "I've changed my opinion about this room too. There's no noise dampening and the voices from all of us in here start to add up."
    natsumi "Uahhh... Can't... concentrate."
    takeru "I was kind of thinking the same thing. How long has it been, an hour?"
    natsumi "Not quite. Hey, why don't we go outside?"
    takeru "Outside?"
    natsumi "There's still enough light to work by. We can set up at one of those tables in the courtyard."
    takeru "Fine by me."
    "With a quick goodbye to Meiko, we make our way through the emtpy halls and out the front door."
    "I drop my books on the first table on the main green. But when I turn around, Natsumi is still by the entrance."
    takeru "What're you waiting for?"
    natsumi "Are you ready?"
    takeru "What?"
    natsumi "Catch!"
    takeru "Wh - "
    "She hurls her bookbag at me. It's only by reflex that I catch it."
    takeru "What are you doing? Were you aiming for my face or was that just a coincidence?"
    natsumi "Don't doubt my aim!"
    takeru "..."
    natsumi "What's the hold up? C'mon, throw it back!"
    "What?"
    "I oblige her, returning the backpack with an underhand toss."
    natsumi "That's not what I was looking for."
    takeru "Maybe if you said what you're looking for instead of throwing your bags around you'd find it easier."
    natsumi "Good point. Alright..."
    "But she makes no attempt at explanation and instead draws her chemistry textbook out of the bookbag."
    natsumi "Catch!"
    takeru "Woah! That's heavy you know."
    natsumi "Now throw it back."
    takeru "What on earth are you doing? I'm not doing anything else until you explain - "
    natsumi "C'mon, just throw it back! We're study buddies, right?"
    takeru "What does that have to with anything. Fine."
    "I toss her the book."
    natsumi "Not bad... Still... Okay, here!"
    "She takes a leaf of paper from the front cover of the book and wads it into a ball."
    natsumi "Heads up!"
    "But the paper ball falls well short."
    natsumi "Should've known that."
    takeru "I guess physics isn't your strong suit either. Is that your chem notes you balled up?"
    natsumi "No! Seriously? Oh well isn't this just great..."
    takeru "Can you quit horsing around and just get over here? You can read from my notes if you managed to trash your own copy."
    natsumi "Thanks, thanks..."
    "She finally sits down."
    takeru "Now what was all that about?"
    natsumi "Nothing important."
    takeru "Then what are you grinning for?"
    natsumi "Like I said. Nothing important."
    takeru "I've got a bad feeling..."
    takeru "Alright, what page were we on?"
    natsumi "To be honest I wasn't paying much attention. What's this symbol again?"
    takeru "Don't ask me. Check the index or something."
    natsumi "Ugh..."
    "The breeze is nice and I prefer the mild outdoors to the buzzing study in the library, but..."
    "Neither of us are very good at this. We really are a useless pair."
    takeru "Oh, I almost forgot to mention..."
    natsumi "Did you figure out number eleven?"
    takeru "Yeah right. No, I forgot Hikari told me that she apologizes for... being dismissive I guess. Or rude. Or whatever it was."
    natsumi "Hikari?"
    takeru "You just met her in the front hall, remember?"
    natsumi "Oh... I guess. Right, that pale girl. What was her deal?"
    takeru "It's not really clear to me either."
    natsumi "I don't remember her being rude though."
    takeru "You don't? Well... whatever."
    "That weird feeling starts to creep up on me again, like I'm no longer recalling things as they actually occurred."
    "There's a big black spot over that hallway in Mirako, only a little more than an hour ago."
    "She did ask me to apologize to Natsumi for her, right?"
    natsumi "...Are you alright?"
    takeru "Just a headache."
    natsumi "Maybe we should call it a night. I'm not getting anywhere."
    takeru "Me neither. Head back to the library?"
    natsumi "Yeah."
    "She strikes up a conversation as we cross the empty halls."
    natsumi "Between you and this dumb chemistry stuff..."
    natsumi "Man, I haven't gotten anything done today. And it feels so weird not having at least some sort of practice."
    takeru "So you guys are out there every day?"
    natsumi "Mostly. I run a tough crew, you know? We're not the best there is but there's no other way to get better, right? You know that."
    takeru "..."
    "For one thing, I'd rather not be having this conversation."
    "For another, most of what I had at one point is talent. Sure, talent is nothing without the drive to really turn it into something, but..."
    "Is Natsumi really driving the baseball team of this little school just as hard as the aspiring pros at Tohoku?"
    natsumi "Oh, that's right, you don't play any more or something Booor-innng."
    takeru "Can't help it."
    natsumi "Ah, whatever. Everyone's got their secrets, right?"
    takeru "Er..."
    "She winks at me."
    natsumi "That's what makes me different I guess."
    takeru "You're saying you don't?"
    natsumi "Life's a lot easier when you're open with everyone."
    takeru "Maybe."
    "Isn't that what Meiko said too? I would've never had the nerve to come out and say what she said, so..."
    "I guess I'll just have to deal with the fact that I'll never be able to some things."
    takeru "I'm a bit of a coward I guess."
    natsumi "Heh. Hey, is everyone packing up?"
    takeru "Looks like it."
    "We're finally outside the library. Everyone's on their way out, except for a lone girl in the study room."
    "A few of my classmates give me the odd greeting on the way out the door. All of them say hello to Natsumi, of course."
    "Opening the double doors, I step inside. I need to grab the rest of my things, after all."
    "It looks like the last to leave is... Meiko."
    "In fact, she's still sitting."
    meiko "Hi, Takeru. Are you just here to grab your bag?"
    takeru "Yeah. Thanks again for putting this together."
    "I can't say it was overly useful, but, still."
    meiko "It was my pleasure."
    takeru "You sound pretty tired."
    meiko "Do I? That's unusual. This is what I live for, after all."
    takeru "Really? Well, don't push yourself too hard."
    meiko "..."
    meiko "I have a right to do what I like, alright?"
    takeru "Er, sorry."
    meiko "Ahh, that probably sounded harsh. Sorry Takeru, I must be more tired than I thought."
    "And she's right back to her normal self."
    takeru "Yeah. Get some rest."
    takeru "Actually... I asked yesterday if there was anything I could do to help out with the festival work. You said you needed some help."
    meiko "Ah right... Help... Can't stand asking for help."
    meiko "You... I wouldn't want to..."
    "Something glimmers in her eyes. When did I lose the ability to read her emotions? Could I ever?"
    meiko "Thank you Takeru. It'd be impolite of me to decline, and I could certainly use the help."
    meiko "I'm actually in the middle of reviewing some of the paperwork now."
    takeru "Oh. Is that what all those papers are?"
    meiko "That's correct. All these need to be formatted and summarized before we can put them in the program. And approving them all is another headache..."
    takeru "So I need to rewrite these?"
    meiko "Essentially. Here's our formatting guidlines."
    "She hands me a few pages stapled together. It looks... quite comprehensive. Of course Meiko wrote this."
    meiko "There's a few samples in there as well. You'll need to read each of these and then summarize over here."
    takeru "Right. I guess I can do that. You'll check them at the end, right?"
    meiko "Of course."
    meiko "Here, I'll handle this half and you can deal with these."
    "She hands me a stack of the applications in front of her. It's uncomfortably big."
    takeru "So... Is this all going to be paperwork?"
    meiko "Hahaha, no, don't worry. Where I'll really need help is in moving things in from the town and setting things up closer to the festival. I'll let you know."
    takeru "Right. This looks like it should be enough to keep me busy for a while."
    "Meiko's smile widens."
    meiko "Let me know if there's any trouble, okay? I wouldn't want to get in your way."
    takeru "No, it's nothing like that. I owe you a lot so this is the least I can do."
    meiko "If you say so. Then have a good evening, Takeru."
    takeru "Yeah. You too."
    "I close the glass door to the study room and head out down to the main hall."
    "This looks like it's going to be quite the workload..."
    "It's the least I can do to help out Meiko. While I guess I don't technically owe her a favor anything... it's more like penance."
    "She's forgiven me but I need to do this to forgive myself."
    "It seems I forgot to ask her how soon she needed this done? Tomorrow? What prevents me from turning around to go ask her?"
    "I'm not sure."
    "I'll go home. There's no point working here if I always get distracted."
    "I flip through page after page of applications..."
    "This promises to be a long night."
    

label day05:
    
    "I have a terrible feeling."
    "Is this a dream? Of course not. It would be the first one in a long long time."
    "But that sense of dread..."
    "All of my internal alarms are firing. Danger. Danger. Danger."
    "There's a thump in my chest as I feel the adrenaline."
    "Fight or flight?"
    "Flight."
    "I roll just in time. Kenta's fist swishes through the air."
    takeru "I'm awake! Are you trying to kill me or something?"
    kenta "Good morning Takeru."
    takeru "Can't you just say that instead of hitting me in the face?"
    kenta "Good morning Takeru."
    takeru "Good morning Kenta. Thank you for the wakeup call. How late was I up?"
    kenta "No idea. I'm not sure you quite finished whatever it was you were doing."
    takeru "Wait... Where are all my papers? Where are those applications? Meiko's going to kill me if I lose any of those..."
    kenta "I would've thought you would take more care of them then."
    takeru "What do you mean?"
    kenta "Well when I woke up you were covered with them."
    takeru "Covered... with what, now?"
    "I stand. Somewhere below a few pens and pencils clatter to the floor."
    "After I finished studying, I started in on those festival forms. Kenta was already asleep so I thought I'd work in bed a bit but..."
    takeru "Don't tell me..."
    kenta "Here."
    takeru "Is this...?"
    "He hands me a stack of papers, complete with binder clip."
    takeru "Thanks Kenta, you're a life saver."
    kenta "Sorry if I intruded."
    takeru "Oh, don't worry about it. If I cared about that I would've already murdered you for replacing my clothing with stinging insects."
    kenta "Hm?"
    "I point at the dresser."
    kenta "I have never understood why you keep insisting on trying to put laundry in my display case."
    takeru "Alright, let's just agree to disagree on this one. Thanks for saving the papers."
    "Luckily nothing seems to be bent or torn. Who knows what would've happened if I had rolled onto these while getting up?"
    "...Then again, without Kenta I wouldn't need to dodge punches every morning."
    takeru "I think I finished all of these, at least..."
    kenta "You better hurry up."
    takeru "Got it, got it."
    
    "The morning is cool, but the still air and mugginess promise another grueling day."
    "It's a real shame only Mirako's library is air conditioned. I'd think that with those renovations so recently they could've done the students a favor considering the climate..."
    "Kenta and I part ways at the entrance with a brief (but Kenta levels of formal) goodbye."
    "Of course, when I finally arrive at the classroom, there's plenty of time to spare. At least having Kenta as a roommate will keep me punctual."
    "I take my seat."
    "To my surprise, Natsumi is already at her desk. Is this the first time she's been early?"
    takeru "Good morning. I wasn't expecting you for another hour or two."
    natsumi "Har har. I've decided I need to be a model student now if I've gotta pull my hopeless study buddy through all his classes."
    takeru "Never again."
    natsumi "Aw you're no fun."
    "She tosses a pencil at me. I bat it away."
    natsumi "Aha! So you are left-handed. I thought so."
    takeru "I'm ambidextrous, actually."
    natsumi "Aha! I tricked you into revealing your true power."
    takeru "That's not really a trick. And it's not really a power either."
    natsumi "But your throwing arm's your left."
    takeru "Yeah, but - Wait, what are you getting at? No."
    nastumi "Then your throwing arm's your right."
    takeru "How is this at all relevant?"
    natsumi "Oh, you never know. It's the little things."
    takeru "Or maybe Hikari was right and you are an irrelvant person. Or at least a person who gets hung up on irrelevant things."
    natsumi "Who?"
    takeru "Hikari. You met her yesterday, remember?"
    natsumi "Oh? Some friend of yours? Are you two-timing on Meiko?"
    takeru "Okay, for one..."
    "Where do I even start with this girl?'"
    takeru "Let's pretend I didn't hear that second part. I was waiting outside class and you came out and I was talking with her. That's Hikari."
    natsumi "Talking..."
    takeru "Don't play mind games."
    natsumi "Sorry Takeru. You must be thinking of someone else."
    takeru "Someone else? Who else could I have been talking to?"
    "I hope that quiver of fear didn't manifest itself in my voice. My eyesight seems to tilt to one side."
    natsumi "I don't remember any talking."
    takeru "Well, to be fair, she didn't talk much, but..."
    takeru "So what do you remember about yesterday?"
    natsumi "We teamed up as study buddies, and you proved you can't balance a reaction or throw a backback."
    takeru "Okay I'm ignoring that too. Back up a bit though. It was before that."
    natsumi "Uhhh... Let's see. There was no practice so I hung around in class a bit before we were set to meet in the library, and then..."
    natsumi "Then I came out and found you just staring out the window."
    takeru "S-staring..."
    "..."
    natsumi "You alright? You don't look too great Takeru."
    takeru "I'm fine."
    "It's that feeling again. Hikari was there. Natsumi was there. Next day. Hikari wasn't there. Natsumi is here. One thought after the other. In a circle."
    "One idea stood up like a domino. Set up in a circle, one falling to the next, until each connects with the next."
    "But then which domino fell first? It's a paradox. There's no circle. It's just a massive piled jumble."
    natsumi "Takeru?"
    "Today I woke up. Kenta gave me the papers. Kenta told me to get moving. I grabbed my clothes. I took my pills. Good!"
    takeru "I was just trying to... Never mind, it was nothing important."
    natsumi "Ahhh you looked like you were thinking about something pretty hard. If only you'd put that sort of effort into our study sessions..."
    takeru "Sorry."
    natsumi "Hey I was only joking. Don't get so sincere on me or you'll make me feel bad."
    takeru "You're pretty shameless so I doubt it would have any effect anyway."
    natsumi "That's a little better. You still look a bit pale though. If you're under the weather I can show you to the nurse's office if you like."
    natsumi "Seems like a shame to spoil the only time I came in early though, I was hopping Meiko would notice..."
    takeru "No, don't worry about it. We wouldn't want Meiko to miss this."
    natsumi "Okay! But take care of yourself, alright? You'll be no good to anyone if you collapse in a heap somewhere."
    "To be honest, I'm still not recovered. I doubt I will be until I figure out what actually happened."
    "Either my memory's spotty or Natsumi's memory is just as bad as mine. Unless..."
    "This is the same thing happened with Meiko's ribbon, isn't it?"
    "It's impossible for me to tell without an objective observer."
    "Maybe this is just Natsumi's idea of a massive joke. But didn't she even forget Hikari's name earlier?"
    "Alright."
    "Get a hold of yourself Takeru."
    "..."
    "The vertigo subsides. While I no longer feel like my head is going to pop off my shoulders at any minute, I'm still just confused."
    "Maybe try another plan of attack?"
    takeru "Hey Natsumi."
    natsumi "Hey. You gonna take me up on that offer to show you to the nurse's office?"
    takeru "I think I'm good, thanks. You know most of the people in this school, right?"
    natsumi "I think so. Everyone in our grade at least. Or at least they all know me!"
    takeru "That's the cheesiest pose I've ever seen."
    natsumi "I thought it was pretty good..."
    "She drops the ear-splitting smile and goes back to her calm, calculating neutral."
    natsumi "You want the dirt on someone or something?"
    takeru "Let's go with that for now. Do you know a girl in our year with silver hair? Blue ribbons I think?"
    natsumi "Hmm..."
    takeru "Pale, too. Like she hasn't been outside in a couple years."
    natsumi "Well, I guess I used to know someone like that, sort of. Uh..."
    takeru "I don't think I've ever seen you flustered."
    natsumi "Ohhh, aha, don't mind me. I'm just embarassed that there's someone here I don't know. I even got to know the antisocial transfer student Takeru, didn't I?"
    takeru "I'm really not antisocial."
    natsumi "It makes for a better story though."
    takeru "Don't tell me you're the type of person that goes around slandering everyone just to have something interesting to say."
    natsumi "I'm pretty offended! I'm plenty interesting on my own."
    natsumi "Heya Meiko. Takeru's antisocial, right?"
    meiko "Good morning Takeru, hey Natsumi. What's this now?"
    "Natsumi launches into an explanation while I hold back and consider."
    "While it might've looked to Natsumi that I was just playing around, I really was trying to pick her brain..."
    "And she's pretty bright. I think she knew who I was talking about. Then what was with the reaction?"
    "Why would she pretend to have not seen Hikari? Why would she pretend to forget her name? Is this some prank, like her new hobby of throwing school supplies at me?"
    "Something seems... sinister."
    "I hope this isn't the onset of paranoia."
    meiko "Takeru?"
    takeru "What? Oh, hi Meiko."
    natsumi "Rude. Meiko backed you up and said you were a friendly and well-adjusted person, and you just zoned out."
    takeru "Er, sorry about that."
    meiko "No need to apologize. Are you tired this morning."
    natsumi "It does sort of look like someone gave you two black eyes."
    takeru "You're in rare form. But yeah, I didn't get too much sleep."
    meiko "Oh?"
    takeru "Just studying."
    "I should probably find a better time to give her all these applications."
    meiko "Try to take care of yourself. You wouldn't want anything bad to happen."
    takeru "That sounds weirdly ominous..."
    takeru "Anyway, Meiko, I asked Natsumi, but you wouldn't happen to know anyone with silver hair and - Ow!"
    "While I wasn't paying attention, Natsumi managed to hit me in the ear with an eraser."
    takeru "Look Natsumi I don't understand why you keep throwing..."
    "But something about her looks off. No smile."
    takeru "Whatever."
    meiko "Well, it's almost that time. I'd better address the class."
    "She rises and walks to the front of the room, carrying a notebook."
    takeru "So she does this every morning... I wish I had my stuff together like that."
    natsumi "I was telling you she's good! So don't waste your chance."
    takeru "My what?"
    "Natsumi just winks."
    natsumi "Seriously though, Meiko's seemed out of it recently. Maybe what she really needed was for you to show up. It sounds like you guys were really close."
    takeru "Honestly I don't know how my coming here would help her at all..."
    natsumi "Oh yeah?"
    takeru "Why would I ever go into this with you... I don't know, but I guess she's pretty fast to forgive."
    natsumi "Yep! That's my Meiko."
    natsumi "Wait, but what's that you're talking about exactly? More secrets, huh?"
    takeru "Speaking of secrets, why did you throw that eraser at me?"
    natsumi "I wanted to see what hand you catch with."
    takeru "Right, why would you ever want to know that? And was it really worth interrupting at that exact - "
    natsumi "Shhh, Meiko's talking!"
    takeru "She's been talking for a good thirty seconds already. You're terrible."
    
    "Sure enough, it's not until lunch that I get a chance to turn over the copied forms for the festival over to Meiko."
    "Natsumi's luckily distracted by her million other friends and I manage to find Meiko in a sheltered corner of the hallway outside class."
    takeru "Meiko. I've got those forms."
    meiko "Forms? Oh, right, I'd almost forgot."
    "Was what I was working on that trivial? Oh well."
    takeru "Yeah. These should be all set. It wasn't too bad."
    meiko "You're pretty prompt, aren't you?"
    takeru "You look surprised."
    meiko "Oh, no, I'm sure I was just glad to have them done so quickly. You must've put a lot of time into this."
    "She looks at me as if she were asking a question, but when I don't respond, she begins flipping through the sheets."
    meiko "Looks okay... okay... hm."
    meiko "You had the style guide, right?"
    takeru "Er... Yeah."
    meiko "Hm."
    "She doesn't comment but her expression as she continues to flip through is... not encouraging."
    takeru "If there's an issue I can always go back and fix it. Just let me know, right?"
    meiko "It's... Well, how do I put this..."
    "My heart sinks. I hope she doesn't notice."
    meiko "This reflects on all of us, right?"
    takeru "I'm not sure I get it."
    meiko "It's just my... We have to be perfect. Nothing can go wrong this year at the festival or it'll be terrible for me."
    takeru "Ah, I guess I'm not quite up to the quality you need..."
    "My smile must obviously forced, but Meiko beams in return."
    meiko "Something like that. I just have to have everything be exact, you know? I really appreciate your efforts to help, don't get me wrong."
    takeru "It wasn't that much."
    kenta "Good afternoon, Takeru."
    takeru "Oh... Hey Kenta. I mean, good afternoon."
    meiko "Hello Kenta. It's good to see you again."
    "Kenta stops by. Come to think of it, I've never figured out exactly where he goes for lunch."
    "Meiko waves as he approaches."
    kenta "Hello. Takeru are those the papers were you going over last night?"
    takeru "Er..."
    meiko "Takeru is helping me out with some of the planning work for the festival."
    meiko "It's a good start! I'll probably be able to use some of this when I put together the directory."
    "...Wasn't that what I was copying this stuff over for anyway? Ugh."
    kenta "It seemed more important than that. Takeru was up all night trying to finish those."
    takeru "Kenta, I don't really think you need to - "
    meiko "Oh?"
    "But the damage is already done. Meiko chuckles, quite different from her usual. Then winces."
    meiko "Good work, Takeru. This is a big help."
    takeru "If you say so..."
    meiko "I've got to be going though, sorry. Lunch is with the student council again!"
    takeru "See you around."
    "..."
    "Meiko turns and nods then vanishes back into the stream of students."
    "It seems this has been an unmitigated disaster. I've wasted an evening, failed to help Meiko at all, and embarassed myself on top of it all. Great."
    kenta "I'd think you look a little happier."
    takeru "Hm?"
    kenta "Never mind. I've never been good at reading faces. I just thought you looked upset."
    takeru "Well, generally, you wouldn't point that out to someone, but no, I'm not overly thrilled."
    kenta "I thought you said she was an old friend? Shouldn't you be glad to have your work aprpeciated?"
    "And now I have to explain exactly how I was embarassed to Kenta. Absolutely wonderful."
    takeru "She was just trying to avoid hurting me, I guess. I really didn't help her out much."
    kenta "Oh. She has very high standards, if I remember."
    takeru "I was under the impression you routinely forgot who she even was."
    "I don't know why I'm being so harsh with Kenta. Hell, I practically forgot who Meiko was during my time at Tohoku and Kenta is apparently trying to be supportive."
    kenta "Just because I can never remember names doesn't mean I can't remember people. She was in my class last year, remember."
    takeru "Oh, right."
    kenta "She helped me with a lot of schoolwork actually. But even getting a single answer wrong on a test was unacceptable. Strange girl."
    takeru "Wait, even if you only missed one question she'd hold it against you?"
    kenta "Oh, not me. For herself, I mean. She was probably top of the class anyway. Like I said, strange girl."
    takeru "Her name's Meiko."
    kenta "Oh. Very impressive."
    "From the way he says it, you'd have thought my statement of her name was something of profound genius."
    takeru "Actually, speaking of names..."
    kenta "Please don't ask me the name of anyone. I feel like I'm being teased."
    takeru "Nothing like that, don't worry. I just want to know if you recognize her."
    kenta "I'm even worse with girls."
    takeru "Just give it a shot. Do you know anyone with long silver hair, kind of sickly looking? I think she wears blue. Walks kind of funny. Shows up without warning."
    kenta "Hm. No not really."
    takeru "Thanks... Maybe I'm imagining things."
    kenta "There might've been someone in my class last year that fit that description. Don't ask me her name."
    takeru "Don't worry, her name has apparently defeated much stronger than you..."
    kenta "What's that supposed to mean?"
    takeru "Ignore me, sorry. It's been a long morning. You know anything else about her?"
    kenta "No. People that don't talk to me sort of blend together. I don't even know if I'm thinking of who you're talking about."
    kenta "Is that all? I was headed to lunch."
    takeru "Oh right, sorry. See you later then Kenta."
    kenta "See you later, Takeru."
    "I wave to his back."
    "Kenta's not the worst guy in the world for a roommate. Just don't ask for my opinion of him in the mornings."
    "I guess I should get going too, before Hagami tries to stare me down in the hallway."
    
    "When I show up to the old library, Hagami and Mana are already eating."
    "Again, I can hear them chatting away, natural as anything, beyond the door. I hate to interrupt, but... this is what they requested, right? I'm not really in a mood to slink off somewhere else."
    "Plus if I stand here any longer Mana's liable to hit me with the door on instinct."
    takeru "Hey."
    mana "Takeru! Good to see you! I'm glad you showed up."
    hagami "..."
    "I'm not really quite sure Hagami shares the sentiment."
    "It occurs to me it might be Mana pushing her into these uncomfortable situations in some kind of misguided attempt to face her fears."
    takeru "Good to see you too. What's with all the stuff on the table?"
    mana "Oh? You mean all this?"
    "While the remains, the usual stacks of books on the table are gone, replaced with red and white candles, cheap jewelry, a few crucifixes, and one can of salt."
    takeru "Yeah, that. Is that a censer? Where did you get that, the tea room downstairs?"
    hagami "It's mine."
    takeru "All of this stuff?"
    mana "I supplied the salt!"
    takeru "What on earth were you guys doing?"
    mana "A ghost hunt, of course! Didn't I invite you?"
    "Yes, you did. I think I made the right decision to decline."
    takeru "I didn't realize you were serious. This looks like heavy-duty stuff. Don't you need a vacuum cleaner or something?"
    hagami "No."
    mana "It's such a shame, we never got to use any of it either... I was looking forward to lighting up some candles!"
    hagami "Those are for circles?"
    mana "Magic circles?"
    hagami "Circles."
    takeru "Right, can someone fill me in on what exactly a ghost hunt involves?"
    mana "We're hunting down the supernatural! We'll summon ghosts from the next plane and live happily ever after..."
    "Hagami snickers."
    takeru "Ah... maybe a few more details? You guys find anything?"
    mana "No, I was kind of confused actually. I got all of Hagami's old equipment out but..."
    mana "We just went to the historical society in Mirako. Hagami went through old town documents all night."
    mana "Don't ask me what you can find in all those deed and family records and stuff. That's not very ghostly at all."
    hagami "Research."
    mana "Down there they don't even let you in with candles!"
    takeru "How about with salt?"
    hagami "Of course."
    mana "Not that we caught any ghosts with it. Or summoned any ghosts. Wait, would summoning a ghost be like killing someone?"
    "Hagami starts up a stream of whispers."
    mana "Okay... You can't? Then what...?"
    mana "Okay. But yeah, Takeru, we didn't find any ghosts."
    takeru "Too bad."
    mana "You don't sound very surprised..."
    "Mana pouts."
    mana "Hagami, I want to go on an actual ghost hunt again. Remember last year when you would light all the candles, and then read from that book, and then we'd wear the - "
    "If I thought I'd seen Hagami blush before, it's nothing compared to what's happening now."
    mana "Hagami, speak up! What? ...okay. No. I won't. Sorry! How was I supposed to know? ...okay. I won't bring it up again."
    mana "Sorry Takeru, I was going to invite you a real deal ghost hunt but..."
    hagami "..."
    mana "Okay, I was going to invite you on a 'field expedition' because apparently ghost hunts are not a thing. Also Hagami has never done one before."
    "Mana is straightfaced but Hagami looks like she'd rather be dead than sitting here."
    takeru "Er..."
    hagami "Change the subject."
    "Generally doesn't one just change the subject instead of asking someone else?"
    "Well, it is Hagami after all."
    takeru "Actually... I was wondering if you know someone."
    mana "Me? Or Hagami?"
    takeru "Either, really. She's just someone I ran into. She said her name was Hikari. Long white-silver hair, kind of a strange walk."
    "Mana doesn't blink but Hagami leans in. For once she makes eye contact."
    takeru "If it helps, she always sounds kind of bitter."
    "Hagami looks away."
    takeru "You know her?"
    "Hagami tries to speak for a few moments, but she's not getting anywhere without Mana as an interpretor."
    mana "Okay... Hagami says... She doesn't know anyone like that. She knows a Hikari but that sounds completely different."
    takeru "I guess you don't know her either? How exactly does someone go to school here without anybody knowing them..."
    mana "Maybe she doesn't have any friends. That sounds lonely."
    takeru "Yeah..."
    "Although I hadn't really considered it, she might just study here in name only. Private classes, nobody to talk to..."
    mana "I'd like to meet her!"
    takeru "I'll have to introduce you. Maybe I'll meet up with her today, she's always downstairs in that old tea room."
    mana "One of Mirako's mysteries, I guess!"
    mana "Actually speaking of Mirako's mysteries... You know what you reminded me of?"
    takeru "No."
    mana "The haunting of Mirako High School!"
    "Hagami puts her face in her hands."
    mana "They say the old wing is haunted by malevolent spirits... Books appearing out of nowhere... The smell of green tea drifting down the hall... Spirits that stalk the halls at nights and chase down the students!"
    takeru "Oh yeah? What's with the spirits?"
    mana "When they built the new half of the school, they built it on the site of an ancient Shinto shrine that used to stand on this hill, hundreds of years ago."
    mana "Now the patron god sends spirits to avenge itself on the populace."
    takeru "That sounds a little, er..."
    hagami "Far-fetched."
    mana "Is not! Once last year I took a chess set from the old wing and and brought it up here to the library. But..."
    mana "At midnight, the chess set suddenly vanished! And the next day I found it again, right where I'd left it!"
    takeru "Vanished at midnight?"
    mana "When Hagami and I came in the next day, it was gone. It can only be vanishment at midnight!"
    "Hagami is still stuck covering her face and shaking her head."
    takeru "Mysterious."
    mana "And I've smelled the tea!"
    takeru "I'm pretty sure I know who brewed it..."
    mana "You know a vengeful spirit?"
    takeru "I would more her at a depressing student, but..."
    mana "And once I even saw one!"
    takeru "A spirit?"
    mana "A lone figure, standing in the hall... Pure white. She turned around, and then - "
    "Mana claps her hands."
    takeru "Yeah?"
    mana "Uh, my memory gets kind of fuzzy, but... She was gone! Vanished in to thin air."
    takeru "Weird..."
    mana "Thanks for reminding me of all this Takeru. Hey, Hagami?"
    "Hagami finally turns with an eye roll to face Mana."
    mana "This gives me a great idea."
    hagami "..."
    mana "Why don't we have a ghost hunt - uh, er, field expedition - in Mirako?"
    mana "We'll check out the old wing for any spirits or ghosts, and I'll have the candles and the censer, you can take your salt, and then maybe Takeru can carry the big books while you read from - "
    hagami "No."
    "It's the strongest denial I've heard from her. Something more than a flat refusal..."
    mana "Uh, sorry? I don't understand."
    hagami "That's just... Crass."
    mana "I don't..."
    mana "Sorry if I said something strange Hagami, I know I must be embarassing you!"
    hagami "It's not... It's not that bad. I guess."
    mana "Then you'll really come on a ghost hunt?"
    hagami "Not... Yeah. I will."
    mana "Takeru?"
    takeru "What?"
    takeru "You'll come too right? As an honorary member of the supernatural club?"
    "I'm not sure what's with Hikari's sudden refusal and then acceptance, and I'm pretty sure Mana's imagination is a little overactive."
    "While wandering around Mirako carrying around a spellbook or swinging a censer or whatever Mana has in mind doesn't sound like much fun..."
    "I guess it doesn't sound unfun either though. Books, no, censer, yes."
    takeru "I guess I'll show up. I want to see you make use of all this stuff."
    mana "This isn't even half of it! Hagami used to - "
    hagami "We'll be happy to have you."
    takeru "Ah, thanks."
    "She almost said that naturally."
    mana "How does Sunday evening sound?"
    takeru "It's not like I have other plans, I guess... Should I bring anything?"
    mana "A flashlight, for sure! The school should be unlocked I hope... Hm... Definitely some gloves!"
    "Is this a ghost hunt or a jewel heist?"
    mana "...and garlic might not go wrong, just in case. Do you have anything that's been blessed by a priest? Christian or Shinto is fine, depending on what we run into, but..."
    hagami "Just bring salt."
    takeru "Got it."
    
    "When I get back to class, I can't bear to look Meiko in the eye."
    "From chemistry and then into math, she doesn't pay any attention."
    "For her part, she doesn't appear to be judging me particularly harshly. She sits as usual, perfect posture."
    "Instead, I'm distracted by the girl sitting between us. Natsumi is bouncing a tennis ball on her desk."
    takeru "What's with that? Are you picking up tennis now?"
    natsumi "It's a bit late for a career change."
    takeru "Can't have too many hobbies though."
    natsumi "Nope. No tennis for me. This is just..."
    natsumi "Exposition."
    takeru "What?"
    natsumi "Foreshadowing."
    takeru "Not getting it."
    natsumi "Some day soon, when things are really weird, you'll look back on this and it'll all make sense."
    takeru "Honestly things are already pretty weird."
    "Natsumi smirks and stuffs the tennis ball into her bag."
    natsumi "Just keep it in mind is all I'm saying."
    takeru "Whatever."
    "Class finally rolls to a close."
    "Natsumi stretches and yawns and I notice Meiko stirring across from her."
    "Do I want to talk to her? Probably not. I try to make my way to the door as inconspicuously as possible, but..."
    meiko "Hi Takeru."
    takeru "...Hi, Meiko."
    "It's hard to resist her smile. Nothing really seems to hurt her too much."
    takeru "Hey, I wanted to apologize about those papers. I wasn't sure when you wanted them done, so..."
    meiko "Oh don't apologize. I should be thanking you. You've saved me a lot of time."
    "Somehow I doubt it. Why do I feel like dirt?"
    takeru "I might have some time the next couple days to revise them if you want."
    meiko "Maybe it's best if I do them. I'm probably a little picky, haha."
    takeru "Maybe..."
    meiko "Thanks for helping me out."
    takeru "Wait, you said there was more to it, right? Something about setting up? Moving some things up from town?"
    "I still need to make things right with her. And lifting heavy objects is at least something I can't screw up too badly."
    meiko "You've done so much already..."
    takeru "I really haven't."
    meiko "Well, if you say so... I'll know more after the next council meeting, okay? Soon we'll probably need to pick up items the folks who volunteer it in Mirako."
    takeru "I can do that. Let me know whenever you need me."
    meiko "Thanks Takeru. I can always count on you."
    "She's so sincerely forgiven me already. Why did I ever doubt her?"
    takeru "See you tomorrow."
    meiko "Take care."
    "Without Meiko to worry about, there's no rush to leave."
    "Kenta's not exactly in the habit of waiting up for me. Come to think of it, nobody is, really. If I wanted to get some work done I could try the library."
    "Or I could find that room downstairs."
    "The one where I can always find Hikari."
    "On some level I realize that she's dangerous. There's just something about her that causes my head to spin."
    "But... I have to confirm that she's there. She met Natsumi yesterday, right? I'm not misremembering?"
    "I don't want to know the answer."
    "Then if I don't want to know, why do I find myself in the old wing?"
    "This time of day, no one's down here. Just me, searching for this hall's single residence..."
    "I slide open the door to the tea room."
    takeru "Hikari? Are you there?"
    "The curtains are drawn. Then again, it's always been dark when she's shown up here. On instinct I turn around."
    takeru "Hikari! Where did you come from?"
    hikari "Ah, it's still you, Takeru. I'm glad."
    hikari "I followed you here. I was wondering where you were heading."
    "That's plenty creepy."
    takeru "You scared me... I'm opening the curtains. For some reason I thought you were always in this room or something."
    hikari "Really?"
    takeru "Well... Yeah, I guess you just sort of pop up."
    hikari "That would be one way to put it."
    hikari "Would... Would you like some tea? I know it might seem like an odd request..."
    takeru "No, I guess that makes sense. This is a tea room, after all, right? Then again, I've never seen a tea room with all these books and boxes and junk packed in..."
    hikari "No, the strange request, I mean..."
    hikari "Will you make me some tea? Please?"
    takeru "Er..."
    "She spends so much time in her I guess I just thought of her as the hostess. Does she not know how to make tea?\""
    takeru "Can't you do it yourself?"
    hikari "..."
    takeru "Er, I wasn't trying to be rude, I'll start preparing it now, I was just wondering if there was some reason you couldn't..."
    hikari "I'm... very clumsy."
    hikari "Some things are hard. I used to be able to do so much, and now even the simplest things give me a headache."
    hikari "So much concentration, just to open a book or a door, it..."
    "She trips over her words as she keeps rambling on in that monotone of hers. I'd interrupt but I'm at a loss for words."
    hikari "It's all so difficult. That's why... sometimes the easiest thing to do is just sit there."
    hikari "Do you realize each day how much you rely on your hands to accomplish anything? Just a voice is pointless."
    takeru "I..."
    "She raises one of her hands in front of her in that jerky rhythm that's become familiar."
    hikari "Even if they can hear you, if you can't do anything with your own two hands, they just all start to forget you're there..."
    takeru "What... Is this why you're here at Mirako?"
    "Hikari laughs, small and tinny."
    hikari "That's not quite a mental disorder, is it?"
    takeru "Dumb question, sorry."
    hikari "No, I used to have problems with my mood. You know, I'd be down for no reason. This is something else. If I were to give up now, no one would blame me. I'd have a reason."
    hikari "It was never anything severe. I fit right in Mirako though. While I never had many friends, there were always certain people I could count own."
    hikari "I doubt she remembers me now. Let alone misses me."
    hikari "Sorry, it's thoughtless of me to go on about all my silly problems... Forget I said any of that."
    "It's painful to hear her speak like this without any inflection. Does it not bother her?"
    "Should I comfort her?"
    "In a way I hardly know her. But then again, it seems like no one really knows her. I'm not the best she's got, am I? Nobody deserves that."
    "I'm at a loss."
    takeru "...Here's your tea."
    hikari "Thank you. I shouldn't have asked."
    takeru "Oh, I don't mind."
    hikari "Something like this might take hours of focus... I had given it up."
    hikari "It's such a simple thing. I don't know why I..."
    "A smile comes over her face. A small one, but I think I catch a look in her eye of something like... wonder?"
    takeru "You're alright drinking that? I wouldn't want you to scald yourself or anything like that."
    hikari "Oh? You don't have to worry."
    "Hikari doesn't make any effort to drink the tea. Instead, she puts up her two hands like she's warming them at a campfire and inhales deeply."
    hikari "Green tea... Oh how I've missed you."
    takeru "Does no one use this room down here any more? I always thought of it as a tea room I guess."
    hikari "Maybe it was at one point. But there's no one down here in general. They might as well have demolished this half of the school with the rest."
    takeru "You used to make tea though?"
    hikari "I tried at first, but it's frustrating. It should take fives minutes and... I'm embarassed to say what it cost me."
    takeru "Well at least this explains Mana's ghost tea thing..."
    hikari "Hm?"
    takeru "Nothing."
    "I take a sip of tea."
    takeru "It does remind me though..."
    takeru "Do you know anyone named Natsumi?"
    hikari "No."
    "The first ping of panic hits."
    takeru "Really? I introduced you yesterday. Then again, you didn't seem very interested in her name..."
    takeru "We met in that hallway outside the classrooms, remember? You remember meeting me there yesterday right?"
    hikari "Oh..."
    hikari "I guess I did meet her. She's irrelevant."
    "That's a relief. I'm not going crazy. Well, I'm not actively going crazier I guess."
    takeru "She's not irrelevant to me, so it'd be nice if you could at least learn her name. You almost gave me a heart attack there."
    hikari "No doubt she had no interest in my name..."
    takeru "Wait. That's right, if you remember Natsumi, why doesn't she remember you? I thought I was just misremembering things, or I was confused or..."
    hikari "People would rather not acknowledge someone like me exists."
    hikari "But what about you? You're in the habit of seeing things? Things that aren't really there?"
    takeru "Er..."
    "It's not something I'm comfortable discussing with anyone, but..."
    "Damn, why aren't I comfortable with this? Hikari just pretty much laid bare a bunch of her little insecurities, so..."
    takeru "I'm a diagnosed schizophrenic."
    hikari "Then... isn't that hearing voices?"
    takeru "No, not really. It's a new thing for me. Six months ago even I just thought I had a bad memory or that people were playing practical jokes on me."
    takeru "But it just felt like my perceptiong of the world was always... off. Just barely parallel to what was actually going on."
    takeru "And then every once in a while, things diverged."
    takeru "That was before I was on any anti-psychotics though or anything like that. So far I've been normal, mostly, I think."
    takeru "Or maybe not. I've started to feel I'm missing small things, or else people are noticing things that I'm not."
    takeru "You seem to bring that out especially."
    "Hikari stares into her tea."
    hikari "Like everyone knows something you don't. And it feels like your deficiencies are so obvious to them..."
    takeru "That's it."
    hikari "This year it's felt like I've lost my mind a thousand times. Everyone in this place seems to be part of a grand conspiracy to blot me out of existence."
    hikari "Everyone but you."
    takeru "Me?"
    hikari "Maybe it's because last year you didn't know me... Or maybe because we share that vague feeling."
    hikari "Either way, no matter how much I talk to someone or follow them around, the next day it's like I was never there."
    takeru "Are... Are you sure you actually did talk to those people?"
    takeru "That's what it was like for me. I could've sworn I'd said one thing when I'd said another, or that things played out one way when everyone knew it was wrong."
    hikari "You even introduced me to Natsumi, didn't you?"
    takeru "...I guess."
    "The small rush from being honest about my condition for once is fading into more general confusion. I mentally check if I took my meds to day. Yes."
    takeru "I still can't shake that. I feel like that whole thing could be all in my head."
    hikari "A figment of the imagination..."
    takeru "Right."
    hikari "I'm not a figment of your imagination. I'm right here."
    takeru "You're right there. And somehow I'm the only one that can remember you."
    "Hikari laughs again, more natural this time."
    hikari "It's a twisted symbiosis, isn't it?"
    takeru "What's that supposed to mean?"
    hikari "I anchor you, you anchor me. You're proof that I'm not slowly going crazy. And me for you. Whenever you doubt something, I know the truth. I'll be there."
    takeru "Er..."
    "I feel like I'm supposed to say something in turn but I'm still not sure exactly what she's getting at."
    takeru "You're a very abstract person."
    hikari "That's an odd choice of word."
    takeru "Er, sorry, I don't even know what I mean half the time. I'm not the best with words and my head is going kind of nuts right now."
    hikari "Tea helps."
    "I finish my cup. She still hasn't touched hers."
    hikari "I'm sorry if I said anything strange. You should just forget about it."
    takeru "It's fine."
    hikari "It's been too long since I've really talked with someone like I meant it. Usually it's irrelevant."
    hikari "So I probably sound a bit out there."
    takeru "I'm sure I look like that all the time."
    hikari "No. You seem bright. Or at least like you can think straight."
    takeru "Yeah, I wonder about that..."
    hikari "Maybe... Do you play chess?"
    takeru "I know the rules, but that's about it."
    hikari "You'll be fine. It's been so long since I've played... The board's on the shelf over there."
    takeru "What?"
    "Oh right. I'd probably better go get it myself."
    hikari "Sorry. You're probably not interested. Just - "
    takeru "No, that sounds fun. It's not like I've got anything else to do right now."
    "Luckily. Around this time yesterday I'd be slogging through chemistry or Meiko's awful paperwork."
    takeru "This is it, right?"
    hikari "The pieces are in the box right next it."
    "I begin to set up the board. Hikari has her hands in her lap again. That tea must be cold."
    "Hopefully the setup is right. I'd rather not embarass myself even more today."
    takeru "Are these actual wooden pieces?"
    hikari "Yes."
    takeru "Funny. They almost look hand made."
    hikari "You have a good eye."
    takeru "They are?"
    "She smiles, weakly."
    hikari "Once upon a time I made them myself."
    takeru "Wait..."
    takeru "Did this set go missing at one point?"
    hikari "Someone stole it a few months ago. It took me almost all day to find..."
    takeru "Let me guess, it was in the old library?"
    hikari "The... That's uncanny."
    "I think Mana would more find you uncanny."
    takeru "Ah, not really. I know who took it. You could've left a note or something saying why you took it back."
    hikari "What's the point when everyone would just pretend they never saw it?"
    takeru "Have you ever thought maybe that's why everyone acts the way they do?"
    hikari "...No, I hadn't."
    takeru "Er, sorry, I didn't mean to say that, really."
    hikari "That's fine. I didn't used to be so blunt, I swear. Only I've learned that past a certain point everyone just acts the same regardless of how you treat them."
    takeru "That's a bit grim."
    hikari "Forget it then. Let's just play."
    takeru "Right."
    "The board set up, I advance a pawn. At least I think this is a common move, right?"
    hikari "..."
    "Maybe not."
    hikari "E5."
    takeru "Er..."
    hikari "The pawn."
    takeru "I'm still not understanding."
    "Hikari extends her hand, shaking."
    "Right. She wouldn't be able to actually move the pieces properly."
    takeru "Er, you want me to play your moves?"
    hikari "That... That would be the idea. It's inconvenient. Sorry. Let's just pretend I didn't bring this up. I was hoping..."
    "I advance her pawn two squares."
    "...That is what she said, right?"
    hikari "..."
    hikari "Thank you for working with me."
    takeru "It's really not something I mind."
    "I move my own piece. Hikari responds without hesitation."
    hikari "Knight, E6."
    takeru "The numbers count up from white's side, right?"
    hikari "...Yes. Hm, you might be in trouble."
    "I don't think most people would know that."
    "I deliberate a second, then respond. Hikari calls her next move."
    "It's theorertically a simple game, right?"
    "But before too long, Hikari's prediction comes true. My embarassment grows as I continually play into Hikari's hands, like stepping on a dozen rakes."
    "I'm obviously outmatched and easily checkmated."
    takeru "That... That was sure something. You're really good at this."
    hikari "I'm very rusty. I haven't played anyone in over a year..."
    takeru "Really? That doesn't seem fair."
    hikari "You're just not all that good."
    takeru "Thanks."
    hikari "I have confidence that you can learn. What do you say we play again and this time I teach you?"
    takeru "I don't know, learning is not exactly my strongest suit, but I'll do my best."
    hikari "Reset the board then. I'll do what I can."
    "My best is not enough for Hikari. Maybe it would've been better if someone a little better at boardgames had stumbled into her instead of me."
    "I don't think I make a single play that she can't respond to, or that she doesn't have a better alternative."
    "She's also very generous to point them out."
    hikari "You had the opportunity to pin there. Did you not see it? Try the bishop instead."
    takeru "Hikari, I think you're calling moves for both of us and I'm just moving the pieces for both of us."
    hikari "You'll get the hang of it, I'm sure."
    takeru "Let me try just one move on my own."
    "..."
    "I think my play has improved in the past hour or two, let's see if you've got an answer to this, Hikari!"
    hikari "Rook to H6."
    takeru "..."
    hikari "Checkmate."
    takeru "You could've at least had a bit of mercy. Thanks for trying to teach me Hikari but I'm afraid I'm terminal."
    hikari "Thanks for humoring me, Takeru. I'm sure you've got talent."
    hikari "Somewhere."
    takeru "Thanks."
    "She at least appears happy. Some time ago emotion slipped into her voice that I haven't heard before."
    hikari "If you come back I can teach you some opening plays."
    takeru "Maybe I'll stop by then."
    hikari "...I guess you know where to find me."
    takeru "Yeah."
    takeru "You're sure you don't want to find someplace else though? I could introduce you to Mana, I'm sure she'd love to know what happened with that chess set. And Hagami's probably better at this than me."
    "But Hikari looks tired again, and pale. She doesn't respond."
    takeru "Right. For now, I'll know where to find you."
    hikari "Thank you."
    takeru "Where do you live? The dorms? I'm headed there now."
    hikari "I'll... I'll be along, I suppose. Don't wait up."
    hikari "Goodbye."
    "I leave her in peace."
    "Earlier I thought I might be making progress in coaxing her out, but I guess she really does believe every other student in this school is part of some conspiracy against her."
    "Is it paranoia? But even Natsumi forgot..."
    "And she sure was strange when I brought it up with Meiko."
    "Again, I feel like there's something obvious I've missed, some important message pinned to the back of my shirt and everyone can read it but me."
    "Is it the same for her?"
    "I walk home alone, under the setting sun."
    "No matter how many times I run back the events of the past few days, there has to be an inconsistency somewhere."
    "Somewhere, I lost my grip."

label day05b:
    
    "My second week at Mirako draws to a close before I know it."
    "While I doubt I've really accomplished anything notable, but that day I got lost in the old wing seems distant now."
    "The road to and from the dorm is second nature. I haven't missed a lunch in the old library. Although I still haven't so much as drawn a game of chess against Hikari..."
    "As for Kenta..."
    takeru "You're back early."
    kenta "Good afternoon Takeru."
    takeru "Fine, good afternoon Kenta. You're back - "
    kenta "Good afternoon Takeru."
    takeru "Never mind."
    kenta "It's rude to start a thought without finishing it."
    takeru "It's rude to cut someone off."
    kenta "I was being polite by cutting you off. I am not a rude person."
    takeru "Right, whatever."
    takeru "When I woke up I assumed you went up to Mirako to spend Sunday studying or something, but, er..."
    takeru "I'm guessing you didn't get that stuff from school. Unless you robbed the janitor."
    "Kenta shuts the door and puts his cargo down on my dresser. Or rather, puts it down on his insect display case."
    "He's come back with a few smaller packages and two or three jugs of what look like cleaning fluid. White plastic, transparent liquid, a hundred health warnings..."
    takeru "What is that? Embalming fluid? Ammonia? Are you going to douse the room in bleach or something?"
    kenta "This is methyl alcohol. But it does seem to have gotten dirtier in here since you moved in, the bleach thing isn't a bad suggestion..."
    takeru "No, no, sorry I said anything. What for?"
    kenta "My passion."
    takeru "Er, right, just don't drink any of that stuff okay?"
    "I'm not sure whether it's more or less dangerous to get involved. Probably my embalming fluid guess wasn't too far off..."
    takeru "Have fun with that."
    takeru "Hey, do you happen to have a flashlight? I'm also looking for work gloves."
    kenta "A flashlight? What for?"
    takeru "Oh, nothing. I might be going out tonight."
    kenta "What, to vandalize something? What do you need a flashlight for? Mirako might not be a big city but we at least have streetlights."
    takeru "Why would I need a flashlight to - "
    takeru "Never mind. I might go on a, er, field expedition tonight. So I might as well get ready now."
    kenta "Flashlights are in the emergency supply, third shelf, arranged by battery power left to right. Gloves are probably..."
    kenta "Are you wearing a specific jacket? You'll probably want gloves to match that."
    takeru "I'm not trying to make a fashion statement here."
    kenta "Third drawer down, in the pockets of the coats on the right half."
    takeru "How do you keep this stuff straight?"
    kenta "You're a very hard to understand person. I don't know why you keep getting this mixed up."
    "I'm about to complain, but then again, it is his stuff he's lending out."
    takeru "You're the best, Kenta."
    kenta "If you end up vandalizing something I'm still telling the police."
    takeru "I'm not vandalizing anything!"
    "Then again, I'm not sure how quick I should be to dismiss Kenta's concern. Who knows what Mana and Hagami have planned for tonight."
    "If Mana opens a door too quickly or knocks over a few desks or something, I better not end up facing charges."
    kenta "Maybe I'll save some of this work for when you're out then..."
    takeru "I'm not going to ask. I'm probably not going to head out until it gets dark though."
    kenta "That's fine. I need to study for a chemistry test anyway."
    takeru "Oh, I almost forgot about that. Mind if I join you?"
    kenta "You're more than welcome."
    takeru "I've sat down to study for this thing at least three times now and every time it seems something else just gets in the way..."
    kenta "You need a routine. Discipline is the only way to get anything done."
    takeru "Right. Teach me your ways, Kenta."
    "Kenta actually isn't that bad."
    "He doesn't throw books at me, unlike Natsumi. He actually knows the material more than I do, unlike Hikari. And unlike Meiko, I don't feel the need to repent any time we talk face to face."
    "I could've done much worse for roommates. Not failing out of Mirako is worth whatever dresser organizational scheme I'll have to deal with next week."
    "And there are worse ways to spend a Sunday."
    
    "Dusk."
    "While Kenta wasn't lying when he said there were still streetlights around here, the road up to the school isn't particularly well-lit."
    "I turn on the borrowed flashlight. The road might be familiar by day, but with the setting of the sun, I lose sight of the usual landmarks."
    "At the overpass, I can make out the lights in the windows down in Mirako below. The entire town lies before me."
    "With the flashlight on I just feel silly. It's not even dark out yet. In fact this whole thing is silly."
    "I can't remember why I agreed to this. The more I feel self-conscious, the more I wonder why I was interested in seeing Hagami recite Latin or whatever I was expecting."
    "We obviously don't know each other very well and it's clear to me she's uncomfortable with me around. All the same it seems we share something, even if she's not able to express it."
    "Or maybe Mana just bullied me into this."
    "Just as it's becoming difficult to see, the Mirako gates come into view."
    "There's not going to be anyone else here this time of night on a Sunday, of course. One of the classroom lights is on, visible through the school's glass exterior. Is someone staying late?"
    "I must be early. There's no sign of anyone at the tables in the courtyard, much less Mana or Hagami. The only thing more embarassing than showing up for a ghost hunt in the first place would be getting stood up at a ghost hunt."
    "I take a seat at a table."
    "Just as I'm starting to worry, there's a thump at the opposite corner."
    takeru "Who's there? Ow!"
    "I turn on Kenta's flashlight but only manage to blind myself with it."
    hagami "..."
    takeru "Well?"
    "I rub my eyes. The low chuckle across the table only confirms that the person sitting opposite me is Hagami."
    "I'm more worried about permanent cornea damage at this point than I am worried about embarassing myself, so I ignore her for now and concentrate on my burning eyes."
    "When I finally manage to see anything, Hagami has one of her usual books out on the table. The thing resembles a cinderblock."
    takeru "Good to see you. I guess Mana's not here yet?"
    hagami "...No."
    takeru "I was worried I'd gotten the date wrong."
    hagami "No. ...Unfortunately."
    takeru "Sorry. I know you're generally happier when I'm not around. I just showed up because, well..."
    "I have no idea why."
    hagami "I mean..."
    hagami "Unfortunate for you."
    "She keeps her gaze on her light reading as we talk."
    takeru "I was kind of afraid of that. I should've known if Mana was involved it'd be something I... Is that for me?"
    "Hagami isn't looking at me, but she has her arms outstretched offering me what appears to be..."
    takeru "Is that a sack or something?"
    hagami "...For you."
    takeru "What?"
    hagami "..."
    "I have no choice but to take whatever she's holding out for me. What I thought was a burlap sack is actually some sort of brown garment, folded over itself. I stand up and unfurl it in front of me."
    takeru "Don't tell me... This is a robe. Am I supposed to wear this? It even has a hood. I'd look like a monk or something."
    hagami "For you."
    takeru "You don't have a robe on. Why am I supposed to wear this thing? Where did you even get this? Are you sure this is necessary?"
    hagami "..."
    "It's clear there are certain expectations of me."
    "The longer I protest in front of Hagami the sillier I'm going to look. She flips a page, completely ignoring my protest."
    "It's not like anyone will see me like this, right? And surely Hagami has a wizard hat or something she'll put on, if Mana's right about her owning all of those candles and other junk..."
    "Okay. It could be worse. I take a deep breath and don the robe."
    "Scratchy. A bit misshapen."
    "Under normal circumstances I'd never be caught dead in this, but Hagami's brand of silent persuasion..."
    mana "Ahhhh! Takeru! You came! And you look amazing!"
    "Oh great."
    takeru "...Hi, Mana."
    mana "I love the robe! It matches mine completely! I'm so happy you're into this!"
    "Mana has arrived."
    "She's clothed almost identically to me in some sort of dull sack turned into a garment, except she also has what looks like a dozen pieces of costume jewelry strung around her neck."
    "Her backpack looks to be full to bursting too, and a book even bulkier than Hikari's rests under her arm."
    takeru "Thanks. I mean, uh..."
    "Thankfully the light's too dim for either of them to notice me flushing red."
    "Hagami has her face screwed up, not looking at me, but clearly trying to hide her laughter."
    takeru "I've been set up. Thanks a ton."
    mana "Huh?"
    mana "Anyway, I hope I didn't keep you guys waiting for long. I almost forgot the red candles! That would've been bad, right Hagami? What would we have done with just the white ones?"
    mana "Actually, Hagami, where's your robe?"
    hagami "Forgot."
    "Hagami shrugs. It's the least convincing thing I've ever seen."
    takeru "You can't pretend that you didn't..."
    "She flips another page."
    takeru "Never mind. Fine. I'm taking this thing off."
    mana "What? Why? I was so happy you showed up with your own gear... I was really counting on you Takeru."
    mana "Hagami, what happened to your robe?"
    hagami "...Forgot."
    takeru "I don't believe this."
    mana "Are we gonna get started or what? Hagami?"
    "Hagami slams her book shut with a snap and gives Mana some kind of salute."
    mana "Roger! Should we assign duties first? This is gonna be so much easier with Takeru around! Thanks for coming, Takeru. But should we figure that out now? Or go somewhere first?"
    hagami "...The library?"
    mana "The old library? Alright. I guess we need to pick up the censer after all. Takeru, you've got censer duties, right?"
    takeru "Censor what? I was kind of just planning to watch. I'm not a full member, so -"
    mana "Oh don't be silly! You've got the initiate's robe on, so I hereby dub you an apprentice member of the Mirako Society of Supernatural - "
    takeru "Nope, sorry. Not joining just yet."
    mana "Awww..."
    takeru "I'm not forgiving you for this, Hagami."
    mana "Huh?"
    hagami "...Dunno."
    takeru "Yeah, thanks. Right, let's just go to the library then and I can get this ridiculous thing off."
    "The school is thankfully unlocked. I think back to that one light on through the glass. Is some administrator staying late? Or are things always left wide open like this?"
    "If I end up suspended for trespassing my second week here, while wearing a potato sack nonetheless..."
    "Still, I follow after the energetic Mana and the stoic Hagami."
    "In the modern half of Mirako, lights flicker on and off as we traverse the hallway. No doubt there's some sort of motion detector installation."
    "But as we cross into the older half, the light fades. Mana clicks on her flashlight, but instead of shining it ahead of us, she holds it under her chin and turns around to face Hagami and me."
    mana "Members, and uh, apprentice, of the Mirako supernatural club, are you ready for the greatest ghost hunt of the year?"
    hagami "Field expedition."
    mana "Fine. Master Hagami, are you prepared?"
    "I catch Hagami cringing next to me. I have no pity. You're as much responsible as me for this Hagami.\""
    hagami "...Yes."
    mana "And initiate of the supernatural club, Takeru. Are you ready for your induction?"
    takeru "Induction? I'm not that good with physics. Or do you mean..."
    mana "Then it's settled! Tonight we journey to the heart of darkness. To the forbidden reaches of the most mysterious of schools... Mirako High!"
    takeru "What?"
    hagami "Hooray."
    mana "Master Hagami, light the candle!"
    "Mana extinguishes her flashlight."
    hagami "Matches. The matches are..."
    mana "Oh. Right. They're in the sanctuary?"
    takeru "Wait, hang on, what - "
    hagami "The library."
    "Mana's flashlight clicks on again, further scarring my pupils."
    mana "Onwards!"
    "I follow Mana's lead through the lowest floor of the old wing. Hagami's light footsteps nevertheless echo behind me. We pass Hikari's tea room."
    "While on the one hand, I feel stupid as anything trapsing through the hall of my highschool in some knockoff monk's robe following this wannabe-cultist with a flashlight..."
    "...But the old wing is unsettling enough in the daytime. I remember those times Hikari managed to sneak up on me. I glance behind my back, but the only one there is Hagami... staring down at her book as we walk."
    "Some things never change."
    "Nevertheless, I try to control my heartrate. I finger the switch of the flashlight in my jacket pocket."
    "When we reach the old library though, Hagami flicks on the lights."
    "Even during the day this place never received any natural light, so now in the evening it looks no different. Encyclopedias, novels, and textbooks alike litter the table. Dust rises as Hagami pulls out a chair."
    takeru "Hagami, do you really have to turn on the radio?"
    "For her this looks no different than a weekday lunch. Hagami fiddles with the radio dial, and the usual low hum of the orchestra comes into tune."
    hagami "Have fun."
    "She deploys the oversized book she's been carrying through the halls and kicks back. Mana and I are left looking at each other in our matching \"robes.\""
    takeru "Mana, where did you even get these things anyway? Did you rob a sack race or something?"
    mana "Huh?"
    takeru "Oh never mind. What exactly are we doing here?"
    "Mana remains silent, but Hagami doesn't bother to glance up from whatever book is open in front of her. I swear the language reads from left to right."
    mana "Matches! They're around here somewhere, right?"
    hagami "Don't know."
    mana "Initiate Takeru."
    "..."
    takeru "Are you talking to me?"
    mana "You're the only initiate and the only Takeru, right?"
    mana "Initiate Takeru, your job is to locate the matches. When you find them, bring them to Master Hagami for the traditional lighting of the ghost-hunting candles."
    hagami "..."
    mana "Uhhh, the lighting of the field expedition candles."
    hagami "..."
    mana "Uhhh, bring the candles to Master Mana then I guess. I'll help you look."
    "Mana starts searching through every cabinet and shelf of the library. I'm left to poke around and the pile of supplies at the table where Hagami sits reading."
    "And the radio's even on... It's as if this is just another lunch break for her."
    takeru "This was very devious."
    hagami "..."
    "Mana runs over holding up something in her hand."
    mana "Found them. Hagami, here."
    "A few specks of dust rise as the matchbook lands between Hagami and whatever it is she's reading. I'm not very surprised when she pretends not to notice."
    mana "Hagami?"
    mana "Oh, right. Takeru, want to do the honors? I got these candles just for tonight!"
    takeru "You seem, er, really into this, so I'll leave it to you."
    mana "Thanks Takeru! Hagami, can you pass me those? Thanks. Now, let's see... gotta be careful, don't want to light the robe on fire..."
    "I wouldn't particularly mind lighting my robe on fire once this is all over."
    mana "Alright, if I've got the candle, then Takeru that leaves you with..."
    takeru "Hang on, what's this thing again?"
    "Mana's trying to hand me what looks like a bronze rabbit on a chain. I take it, thinking things would be so much easier if I could just pretend to ignore things like Hagami."
    mana "It's a censer!"
    takeru "Oh, right. I didn't recognize this one. Aren't they usually shaped like, I don't know, balls with holes in them?"
    mana "Any shape works. Hagami always wants to use that other one with runes carved into it and says it has stronger ties to the netherworld..."
    hagami "It's true."
    mana "But this one's tons cuter. We'll attract cuter ghosts like this, I'm sure."
    "I'm not so sure, but I unscrew the bottom as Mana strikes a match."
    "Before long, a noxious, leafy smell infiltrates the library. It has the distinct flavor of overstewed vegetables. Hagami coughs."
    takeru "This... I'd be really suspicious of any ghost that was attracted to this."
    mana "It's Hagami's special incense."
    hagami "Nope."
    mana "You specifically made this last year! I got you the mint sprig and everything, and we made sure to grind it on the full moon, but you said that - "
    hagami "Nope."
    "She's once again refusing to make eye contact over the edge of the book."
    takeru "Do I just swing this back and forth, or what?"
    mana "Yep! That's it."
    takeru "Maybe we should go outside or something. Wouldn't want to suffocate in here."
    "Already it looks to me like Hagami's trying to suppress a coughing fit behind that tome of hers."
    mana "Alright!"
    "She heads out the door, but Hagami remains lost in her reading."
    takeru "Hagami, you're not coming?"
    "She looks up, but makes no sign of moving. Instead she flashes me a thumbs up."
    "Thanks Hagami."
    
    "The school roof is quite different by night."
    "By now the sun is truly down, but night hasn't fully settled. The moon shines white against the gray sky."
    "The street lamps on the outside road throw shadows into the courtyard. Somewhere downstairs, that one light remains on."
    "Mana stands silent by my side."
    "I try to think of something to say, open my mouth, and inhale a healthy dose of Hagami's special full moon incense."
    mana "Are you okay?"
    takeru "Ah..."
    "Finally my coughing subsides."
    takeru "Er, just swallowed funny I guess. At least it's cooler out here than in that library you guys are always at. This robe is pretty thick."
    mana "Yeah."
    takeru "So what's next? How does one hunt for ghosts?"
    mana "I'm not really sure. Hagami's the expert. I was kind of hoping she'd be more into it... She's kind of why I set this whole thing up."
    takeru "Wait, really?"
    mana "Mhm."
    mana "It's a lot of fun! Like a camping trip. In the heat of that ghost-hunting spirit... You really get to know each other!"
    takeru "I hope she's not sitting this out because I'm here."
    mana "Nahh, she's pretty much used to you I think. Maybe? Dunno. She's hard to read."
    takeru "Well you're her best friend right?"
    mana "Everyone's got their secrets."
    "And everyone keeps saying that."
    mana "It's such a romantic idea though, isn't it?"
    takeru "Romantic?"
    mana "Stillness. Murky perfume. Darkness... And then. Your eyes meet. And for the first time... You truly see each other..."
    "She's gazing off into space."
    "This is awkward. I have no idea if this \"eyes meeting\" business is talking about herself and me, me and Hagami, or herself and some supernatural sweetheart that we're hunting for."
    takeru "Er..."
    mana "Never mind, never mind."
    mana "Don't get me wrong, I still want to find some ghosts! We'll just have to improvise instead."
    takeru "After you."
    "Mana pushes open the door to the stairs and we walk downwards to the old wing. I do my best not to trip over the chain of the rabbit censer."
    "We finally come to that familiar corridor. I think at this point I could count the doors to Hikari's tea room even by the feeble candlelight."
    mana "Slow down."
    "She starts to pause a second or two before each step, right after left. Am I supposed to keep time like a marching band or something? I almost trip over the hem of the robe dragging behind her."
    mana "Follow my lead."
    mana "...Kind of tough to see."
    "She holds the candle over head. I raise my hand with the censer chain to match before realized that this accomplishes nothing except to make me look even dumber."
    "Mana's candle flickers. The only noise is the rattle of the rabbit censer as it swings back and forth. I take another step behind Mana."
    mana "This is the part where Hagami's book would come in handy. Those Rosicrucians had some good ghost chants. Too bad that couldn't save their civilization though, huh?"
    takeru "Er, I'm not sure - "
    mana "Hey Takeru! Quiet a sec!"
    "Mana waves behind her to shush me, but try as I can, I can't hear anything."
    mana "You heard that right?"
    takeru "Nothing."
    mana "It was like... a footstep!"
    mana "I think we flushed one out! What do you think? Should we check the rooms?"
    takeru "It couldn't be... Right, let's see if anyone's here."
    "She moves off the check a room at random, but I know just where I'm headed."
    "My hand rests on the tea room door. There's no way, right?"
    "It slides open. Armed with perfume instead of a candle, I can't see a thing."
    takeru "..."
    takeru "Hikari? You're not there, are you?"
    "..."
    mana "Takeru! Did you find something? I heard you talking."
    takeru "Just muttering to myself. Looks like the room's empty."
    mana "Ohhh, right, this is the old tea room. Let's check it out!"
    takeru "Careful not to trip over the table."
    "I can just see her burning down the school."
    mana "Nope. Nobody home. No ghosts..."
    takeru "Let's regroup in the hall."
    "Mana follows me out the door."
    mana "Any other ideas?"
    takeru "Er, I'm honestly not sure what else there is to do. Are there haunted places on Mirako grounds or something? You mentioned some sort of shrine?"
    mana "Well they built the school on top of it, you see, so it's not around any more."
    mana "Let's just head up to the library. Even if we didn't find anything, we can at least get some reading in!"
    takeru "I didn't bring any textbooks."
    mana "We can find something for you."
    takeru "As long as it's you picking and not Hagami."
    "I lead the way back down the hall to the stairwell."
    "Our pace is a lot faster without whatever Mana was doing on the way here, and I no longer feel compelled to swing my rabbit around."
    "But..."
    mana "Ow! Takeru, don't just stop dead in the middle of the hall like that! You can't blame me when I..."
    "It's just like Mana described."
    "Darkness."
    "In the stillness..."
    "...there's something ahead."
    "Eyes."
    "Eyes staring."
    "Eyes staring at me."
    "Someone, no, something, is standing in front of me."
    hikari "Takeru?"
    "The censer hits the ground with a clang."
    hikari "Takeru, that is you. What are you doing around here so late?"
    takeru "W-w-what are..."
    takeru "Hikari you scared the hell out of me! What are you doing here?"
    hikari "Didn't I ask you that?"
    mana "Wow..."
    mana "You must be..."
    hikari "Can you get that candle out of my face?"
    mana "A ghost..."
    hikari "No."
    takeru "I'm sorry, Mana, this is my friend Hikari. She spends a lot of time down here during the day. And apparently at night too."
    takeru "Hikari, this is Mana, she - "
    hikari "I'm not all that interested."
    mana "A ghost... Hm, less cute than I thought... And I was so sure the rabbit censer would do the trick..."
    hikari "Wait. Takeru, what are you doing with that? Doesn't that belong in the tea room?"
    takeru "Does it?"
    mana "I moved it up to the library a couple weeks ago. It's not like anyone uses any of the rooms down here."
    hikari "I do."
    mana "Well of course! But you use it in the afterlife, right?"
    hikari "Again, I am not a ghost."
    takeru "Oh, Mana, I forgot to mention. I figured out what happened with that chess set..."
    hikari "Are you the thief that keeps taking things from my room?"
    mana "Sorry! If I'd had known there was a vengeful ghost - "
    hikari "Vengeful human. Please don't take others' belongings without asking. That set is handmade, you know."
    mana "Sorry sorry sorry! I didn't mean any harm!"
    hikari "Anyway, I came to pick up my books. I accidentally left them down here yesterday afternoon."
    takeru "Do you want to borrow a candle or something."
    hikari "I think I'll be fine."
    "Hikari shields her eyes from the candle Mana still holds only a foot or so from her face."
    takeru "Are you sure? We can come with you."
    hikari "I don't know what you're doing wandering around here dressed like the inquisition but I'd rather not have any part in it."
    "Oh, right. I'm still in this ridiculous getup. Hopefully it's too dark for Hikari to notice my blushing."
    takeru "Er, right. We were uh..."
    mana "Field expedition. Very serious stuff."
    hikari "You two have fun with that. I'll see you Monday, Takeru, hopefully dressed normally."
    takeru "For sure. Sorry about this whole thing."
    hikari "Your hobbies are your own business, I don't mind. Bye."
    "She vanishes off behind us as quickly as she came, footsteps not so much as echoing in the hall."
    "This... has pretty much been a disaster."
    mana "I'm almost giddy. I've just seen my first ghost."
    takeru "Oh knock it off."
    mana "Sorry. What did you say her name was again?"
    takeru "Hikari. She's a bit of an odd one. She might seem a bit prickly, and she spends all her time cooped up down here, but..."
    "I'm not sure where I'm going with this."
    mana "Maybe I'll Hagami we found a ghost, anyway. That'll make her jealous. Then next full moon, for sure, she can do those chants, and I'll have my pick of ghosts, and they'll be so much more polite..."
    takeru "That's right, don't get discouraged. There's a ghost out there that's waiting for you."
    mana "Thanks Takeru!"
    
    "Hagami is waiting for our return."
    "I leave Mana to recount the night's encounter and instead busy myself with removing my robe as quickly as possible."
    "Both the girls look like they've decided to settle in for an evening of reading in the old library, and without a book in hand, I'd rather not risk hanging around before I get another manual of metaphysics thrust at me."
    takeru "I'm headed out. It was nice ghost-hunting with you."
    mana "You too Takeru! Thanks for being a good sport! Hope we didn't embarass you too much in front of your friend!"
    "I have no idea how I'm going to spin this one tomorrow."
    takeru "Yeah, thanks a million. And Hagami, you don't have to hide. I can tell you're laughing over there."
    "She turns away from me instead, then turns back stonefaced."
    hagami "Have a good evening, high spirit inquisitor Takeru."
    mana "Good night, Takeru!"
    takeru "You too."

label day06:

    "My instinct when I wake up is to curl into my ball and cover my forehead."
    "But... apparently even though I was out so late last night, I haven't overslept. There's no Kenta poised to pounce on me from above."
    "...then why does it feel like something is looming over me?"
    "I open my eyes to a blurry vision of the dorm at morning. I only truly feel safe when I hear soft breathing from Kenta on the other side of the room. Snoring. Still asleep."
    "I can't seem to focus right."
    "Was last night really that big a deal that I'm still spinning this morning?"
    "As I predicted, it was a disaster, and the only thing I really have to show for this whole ghost hunt business is going to be an awkward conversation with Hikari."
    "Well, I guess it's not like I ever believed in ghosts anyway, so what did I expect really?"
    kenta "...snuagh..."
    takeru "He must really be out of it..."
    "What time is it anyway?"
    "I try opening my eyes but they're already open. I can't see the alarm clock on my dresser through the blurriness. And why does everything have a green tinge to it? And what stinks?"
    "That incense must've really done a number on me..."
    "Then my focus changes."
    "There is something standing over me."
    "Two eyes."
    "Translucent turquoise skin covering its blobby body."
    takeru "G-g-g-ghost!"
    takeru "G-ghost... frog."
    takeru "That's an honest to god pickled frog."
    kenta "Takeru! You can stop screaming. I'm glad you're up early but it's a little early to give me a wakeup call."
    kenta "And what's with the yelling? I wasn' that deep asleep, was - ?"
    takeru "Kenta!"
    kenta "I said I'm awake."
    takeru "There is a frog on my dresser. There is a jar of weird liquid in it on my dresser, and in that jar there is a frog. Why is there a frog on my dresser? Kenta, what on earth - "
    kenta "Good morning Takeru."
    takeru "Kenta, why on earth did you - "
    kenta "Good morning Takeru."
    takeru "Good morning, Kenta. Now can you just explain this..."
    "I gesture around the room."
    "It's actually worse than I thought. There are a few jars arranged in a grid in the middle of the floor, and that white bucket is also taking up real estate on my dresser next to that terrible terrible frog."
    "It's still looking at me."
    takeru "Why did you pickle a frog and stand it over me, Kenta?"
    kenta "The proper term is embalming. It's a preserved frog. I wouldn't pickle it unless I wanted to eat it, and - "
    takeru "Alright, sorry. What's with the preserved frog?"
    kenta "I'm branching out. Turns out insects themselves aren't very interesting, but preserving them is. What do you think of my first attempt on something larger? A little amateurish, maybe, but with practice..."
    takeru "Great."
    kenta "I'm glad you're interested in my hobbies. It's so much easier to have someone who understands you."
    "Next to my alarm clock, wallet, and ID, that coin Kenta gave me catches my attention."
    takeru "I'm really not sure I understand."
    kenta "I can fill you in on the details this afternoon, if you like. For now we'd probably better start getting ready for school."
    takeru "Probably."
    "I sigh and look away from the coin. In a parallel world, I slept an extra thirty minutes and took my clothes out of that dresser currently occupied by dead insects and amphibians."
    kenta "What were you shouting about ghosts for?"
    takeru "You must've misheard."
    kenta "If you say."
    takeru "One of these days we're going into town and buying you a cabinet or a trophy case, or..."
    takeru "Just... Something. I swear."
    kenta "That's a good thought. If I do end up using the rest of that methyl alcohol on snakes, I'll be out of display space soon."
    takeru "I more meant so you could get the bugs out of the dresser, but..."
    takeru "Just get ready to go."
    
    "The air is completely still in the morning as we walk up the hill road."
    "It passes mostly in silence. Even the rumbling of cars from the town below seems muffled."
    "This same path seems almost familiar now, although I probably haven't been at Mirako a month."
    "At this rate maybe I'll even get used to my roommate."
    kenta "Where were you last night, anyway?"
    takeru "I wasn't vandalizing anything, don't worry."
    kenta "And my gloves?"
    takeru "They're back in the right drawers."
    kenta "You can be a very considerate person when you want to be."
    takeru "Thanks?"
    kenta "You weren't at Mirako, were you?"
    takeru "Well... Maybe."
    "I think I'll avoid bringing up ghost hunting, partially because all I did last night was make myself look stupid, and partially because I'm worried Kenta will pick up an occult hobby to go with his collections of dead things."
    "I really need to get Mana's stories out of my mind. She probably doesn't even believe Mirako's haunted."
    "And it's hard to tell what Hagami's thinking about, but I wonder if she even cares about the supernatural, with those philosophy books of hers."
    "It's pretty embarassing if even if the supernatural club members aren't believers."
    "The only strange stuff I've seen at Mirako haven't really been supernatural at all. There was that weird episode on this very road with Meiko, and maybe..."
    "No one ever seems willing to acknowledge they know Hikari's name."
    takeru "Kenta..."
    kenta "Takeru."
    takeru "You haven't heard any rumors about the old half of Mirako being haunted or anything, right?"
    kenta "Haunting isn't a real thing, Takeru. I didn't know you were that silly."
    "I don't know if I've ever valued Kenta's straightforwardness as much as now."
    takeru "Thanks."
    takeru "Alright... There's no, like, taboo at Mirako is there?"
    kenta "Taboo?"
    takeru "Blackballing people. Or..."
    takeru "There's nothing like a silent treatment? Like if somebody blows a save in the title game, everyone pretends they don't exist for a week?"
    kenta "That sounds bizarre. Why would you just stop talking to someone?"
    takeru "I don't know. I've just felt a little shaken up these past couple days. People not remembering things the way I did."
    kenta "I thought there was medication for that."
    takeru "Wait."
    "Kenta swivels his head around as I stop dead."
    takeru "My meds! Sorry, you can just go on without me."
    "I take off back down the road."
    "Idiot, idiot, idiot."
    "It's been three months since I started taking the antipsychotics and but I've been pretty good about it. Until today I've taken them first thing every morning, every day."
    "Right?"
    "..."
    "Can't be. I'd notice if I missed a day."
    "Right?"
    kenta "Slow down, would you? I don't want to show up to school all sweaty."
    takeru "You didn't have to come back with me you know."
    "He trails behind as we walk back into the dorm."
    takeru "Let me just catch my breath and grab my meds, it shouldn't take long. You could've still made it on time."
    kenta "Showing up at Mirako without you is just as much out of the routine as showing up late."
    takeru "There. Sorry for the wait."
    "Still almost panting, I check my watch."
    takeru "There's still some time. Shouldn't have to run."
    "If it weren't for that floating frog waking me up, we would be late for sure."
    "Then again, if it wasn't for the commotion that horrible thing caused, I wouldn't have screwed up my pills in the first place."
    kenta "This is why it's important to stick to plans. My morning schedule has a spot for medicine. It rotates every seven days, synchronized to which dresser drawer has clothes for that day, which also..."
    takeru "You take pills now?"
    kenta "Just anti-anxiety."
    takeru "Huh. You're about the last person I'd expect to be anxious."
    "He shrugs."
    kenta "A few years ago if you had made be late I'd be a lot angrier with you."
    kenta "Mirako is a great place."
    takeru "..."
    takeru "I never really explained why I came here, did I? Came to Mirako, I mean."
    kenta "No, I don't think so."
    "I can't remember him ever asking, for sure."
    "Is that his form of respect? Incuriosity?"
    kenta "If it was something you needed to share you would've shared it. It's important to share things that are important to you."
    takeru "Right, just like you can't help sharing the bugs and the frogs and the clothing sorting system."
    kenta "You're welcome."
    takeru "...Thanks Kenta."
    kenta "We're here."
    
    "I show up to class barely on time. No sign of the homeroom teacher but Meiko has started in on her daily state of the class address."
    "I'm haven't stopped panting by the time I reach my seat."
    natsumi "How's the morning jog treating you?"
    takeru "I don't need to hear it from you."
    natsumi "A sorry day when even I beat you in. What held you up?"
    takeru "Oh, nothing. Just got a late start."
    natsumi "Well don't be late after class today."
    takeru "Late for what?"
    natsumi "Right after classes, meet me by the back entrance, near the fields."
    takeru "Is this some kind of trap?"
    "She's useless at concealing anything. While she's trying to pretend to pay attention to Meiko's talk, she's still grinning."
    "Definitely up to something."
    takeru "I still haven't forgiven you for chucking that book at me, you know. You have a couple rocks you're going to throw at me this time?"
    natsumi "Shhh. You should be paying attention to Meiko."
    "As if to punctuate her point, she raises her hand."
    meiko "So submit your expenses before - "
    meiko "Natsumi? You've got a festival budget question?"
    nastumi "Just a festival question in general I guess. The fireworks are still happening this year, right?"
    "Meiko makes an unreadable expression before returning to a grim neutral."
    meiko "No. Cancelled. Administration said so. Nothing's changed since last time you asked."
    "There are a few groans from the surrounding students, but Meiko talks over them. Guess she's not done."
    takeru "What's this about fireworks?"
    natsumi "It's a tradition at Mirako, you know. Our school festival always ends with fireworks."
    natsumi "That's the reason have the people from town attend. Plus it's like the mistletoe of summer."
    takeru "Mistletoe?"
    nastumi "They say there's nothing more romantic than that moment under the sky when the fireworks hit their finale."
    "She stops watching Meiko to turn to me."
    natsumi "...if you've got someone special in mind."
    takeru "That's a terrible face you're making."
    natsumi "You can at least humor me a little."
    takeru "Whatever. Why are they cancelled?"
    natsumi "There was fire on festival night last year. The fireworks were over and done with, and they found the fire wasn't even related, but I guess it spooked the administration."
    natsumi "So no fireworks."
    takeru "Too bad."
    natsumi "I wish the rest of the old wing would burn down, then maybe we could get that crypt remodeled as well."
    "With all the talking Meiko does about the festival, you'd think this whole thing would've come up earlier."
    takeru "Oh well, guess it's time for class."
    nastumi "See you later. And don't forget after school, okay?"
    takeru "Fine but don't you dare throw me anything."
    
    "Lunchtime."
    "When I show up at the old library, the door is open for me. I can hear Hagami inside, but she quiets down when I enter and greets me with a smile, then looks to Mana."
    mana "Takeru! Hi! You made it!"
    takeru "Did you think I wasn't going to show back up?"
    mana "Well we thought maybe..."
    "She glances at Hagami."
    mana "After you ran into the ghost last night, you wouldn't want to show up at the supernatural club again."
    takeru "Very funny."
    takeru "I think I've showed up every day here for a while now so I might as well keep at it now."
    "I clear a spot at the table. It's still littered the same novels and textbooks, the old radio, but also some \"field expedition\" equipment, including the robes from last night."
    "I put those on the floor. With any luck I won't ever have to see them again."
    mana "Well thanks so much for coming out last night. I had a ton of fun, and I'm sure Hagami did too."
    "Hagami raises her eyebrows but otherwise gives nothing away."
    hagami "Yes."
    takeru "I'm going to guess that was some sort of weird initiation rite. And I thought Tohoku was bad. I didn't think a two-girl club would go in heavy on the hazing."
    mana "What?"
    hagami "Don't underestimate us."
    mana "Wait, what, Hagami?"
    mana "Oh never mind."
    "Hagami is fully sheltered behind a book at this point, so Mana turns back to me."
    mana "I've never seen a ghost myself before. Sure there are sometimes hauntings and that sort of thing, but I had mostly thought those were rumors."
    mana "And didn't you say you had a friend that knew about some of this too? Like she had a chess set go missing?"
    takeru "Hang on, back up. You met her last night, didn't you?"
    "Hagami glances up for a second."
    "I have a feeling I might be in for another headache. I should've grabbed some aspirin this morning as well."
    takeru "Alright. Let's figure this out. What exactly happened last night? You and I were about to the stairs, and then..."
    takeru "Hikari showed up."
    mana "Who?"
    "Another pause."
    "The only sound is the low orchestra from the radio."
    takeru "My friend. Plays chess. Came late to pick up some books or something."
    mana "You told me about her, but..."
    mana "I only saw a ghost."
    mana "Well, it could've been anything, I guess! Just a stray shadow. I would've thought ghosts were a lot cuter, right? I mean, otherwise what's the point?"
    takeru "We ran into her. I almost literally ran into her."
    mana "You were very brave!"
    takeru "Well, I'd say I was more very embarassed then very brave. That rabbit incense, and..."
    "Mana just looks confused. Hagami's still hiding but I can tell she's not paying any attention to her book."
    mana "The only people I saw last night were you and Hagami. Sorry, Takeru."
    takeru "Why..."
    mana "Or sorry! I should count ghosts as people too!"
    takeru "I'm sick of this. There's not..."
    takeru "There are no ghosts in Mirako. There aren't any ghosts anywhere. Please, just cut it out. I feel like I'm going crazy."
    mana "No... No ghosts?"
    mana "Then what were you doing last night? Why were you so spooked? I don't - "
    takeru "Look, Mana. I know you guys are trying to scare me or something, or maybe you have something against Hikari, but..."
    takeru "It's not funny any more. There's a reason I'm here at Mirako. I have schizophrenia. It's sometimes really hard for me to tell what's there or not."
    takeru "So please just have a little respect, okay? Just..."
    mana "Takeru, I don't... What..."
    "I jump. We're cut off by a blast of music."
    "When I turn around, I see Hagami has her finger on the radio volume control. After a few seconds, she lowers it back."
    "...And then she flips another page in that oversized book."
    "Mana and I stare at each other, when Hagami finally speaks."
    hagami "Thanks."
    hagami "I knew that incense was a little shady."
    "She pulls over the copper rabbit burner from across the table and empties its contents, crosses the room, and empties its contents into the trash."
    hagami "No more field expeditions. At least not here."
    hagami "Takeru, we're your friends. We're not trying to fool you."
    "For once she doesn't break eye contact. I gulp, but it seems that's all she wanted to say."
    "She just turns another page."
    mana "Okay."
    mana "Alright, you're right Hagami."
    "She pushes one or two volumes of that supernatural romance series away from her."
    mana "Let's talk about something else. Do you have any plans for the festival, Takeru?"
    takeru "Not really. Guess it's really a big deal around here, huh?"
    mana "Of course! I really really wanted to put something together with the supernatural club, but the swim team's got a fundraiser, and Yumi needs all the help she can get putting it together."
    mana "You're coming, though, right?"
    takeru "I guess. I've sort of been roped into help planning it."
    mana "No way! You're on the student council?"
    takeru "Er, no, I've been here less than a month, Mana. I'm just helping out a friend who is. It's mostly been paperwork so far."
    mana "And Hagami will be there of course."
    "Hagami looks up. I'd have expected her to giving Mana some cue in whatever eye-based secret language they use, but instead she just stares off somewhere. It looks like even Mana is confused."
    mana "Right Hagami?"
    hagami "Right."
    "She turns the radio dial up a notch. A symphony becomes audible."
    hagami "...Always hated that thing."
    mana "I know there's a lot of people there, but that's half the fun for me! Plus there's always the food, and the fireworks."
    takeru "No fireworks this year I hear."
    mana "Really? That's too bad."
    "Hagami sighs."
    mana "Oh shoot! I forgot my watch was broken! It's time for class. See you later, Hagami! And thanks for coming out last night Takeru."
    "She almost smacks into the door in her escape and vanishes down the hall. Hagami and I follow."
    "But before I've taken a step down the hall..."
    hagami "I believe you."
    takeru "What? Is this about Hikari?"
    "But Hagami just raises her eyes again, and without another word, turns to go."
    
    "I manage to survive classes for another day. Now that the big chem exam is over, it almost feels like I can get used to the workload at Mirako."
    "It's heavier, in a way. Or maybe at Tohoku it never seemed important."
    "While I'm sure it's not going to be a pleasant surprise that Natsumi has ready for me, I figure I should at least keep my appointment. As the last class finishes, she's nowhere to be seen. Meiko, however, is right by the door."
    meiko "Good to see you."
    takeru "Ah. Hey Meiko."
    meiko "I've got to meet up with council in a few minutes, but you wouldn't happen to have some time after that, would you? There's a few festival fine points that could use a hand."
    takeru "Er, sorry, Natsumi wanted me for something."
    meiko "Oh? What?"
    takeru "I'm not quite sure."
    meiko "Well..."
    meiko "Be careful Takeru. She's more clever than she looks."
    takeru "Sorry I can't help out. I hope it's - "
    meiko "Of course. It's not a big deal. I really don't need help, but, you did ask me to keep you busy."
    takeru "Meiko, I'm not... I'll be free tomorrow."
    meiko "That's fine. I'll manage on my own without a problem. See you later, Takeru!"
    "And with a wave of her hand, she's gone."
    "Dammit Meiko. She has a way of turning my best intention on its head."
    "Then again, I really only have myself to blame. Why do I keep getting this guilty feeling? Am I somehow terminally incapable of living up to her expectations?"
    "Or more like I just keep letting her down."
    "Never mind. I have someplace to be. Natsumi, this better be worth it."
    "I hurry down the hall, past the glass overlooking the front walk, and finally head out the back door, along the path to the fields."
    "But there's nobody here."
    "Did I miss her?"
    "I wait a minute, but nothing. Just the breeze, and few voices from over the baseball field on the other side of the hill."
    "The baseball field?"
    takeru "Natsumi..."
    "I take a few steps down the path. While I guess I technically know the fields are down this way, I've never had reason to come down here. I could go the rest of my life without seeing another baseball diamond again."
    "The bleachers are emtpy. A few guys toss the ball around the outfield. Do I know them? That one's in my class. And him? Don't I see him hanging out with Natsumi all the time. And those two. Don't they have lunch with her."
    "There's a knot in my stomach."
    "Sure enough, there's Natsumi, chatting with two or three players down by the dugout. All of those guys that follow around are baseball players. She's the idol team captain, after all."
    "I think I'm going to be sick. What did she want me to do, come down and join practice? Watch from the stands?"
    "Without thinking I take off back down the trail. I don't need to deal with this today. There's too much else going on. Not something I want to spend time on."
    "Only when I get back inside the school do I start to catch my breath and take my bearings."
    "What was even the point of that? Did she give up waiting for me and head down to practice without me? Was I ever meant to get to the field at all?"
    "I start walking the halls without any particular purpose. Someone says hello but I don't bother to reply."
    "The old wing is right ahead."
    "Well, I could go see Hikari instead of wandering around like a lost dog, but after that whole bumping-into-her-while-wearing-robes thing..."
    takeru "Oh what the hell."
    "I push open the door to the tea room. Sure enough, Hikari is sitting there."
    "The table holds a chessboard, half a game in progress, and the rabbit-shaped incense burner. I gulp."
    hikari "Oh. Hello Takeru."
    takeru "Hey."
    hikari "You can sit down you know."
    "I take my place, but she doesn't look at me."
    takeru "..."
    hikari "..."
    takeru "Sorry about last night. I guess you haven't met Mana before?"
    hikari "The loony one? Kept going on about ghosts?"
    takeru "That'd be her. She's well, er... She meant the best."
    hikari "Hardly."
    takeru "Look, I was just humoring her going around in that getup."
    "Hikari snorts."
    hikari "You did look pretty ridiculous. Are you going to be a monk now? Applying to the seminary?"
    takeru "Oh, not quite yet."
    "At least she doesn't seem too shaken up by being called a ghost, if she's laughing at me."
    takeru "Maybe that would be easier. Everyone seems to be in a world of their own these days."
    takeru "At least people would stop trying to trick me about ghost sightings and baseball practices."
    hikari "Baseball practice?"
    takeru "I don't know. Natsumi, that baseball captain, is always after me about something or other."
    takeru "Does tea sound good?"
    hikari "Always."
    "I make the usual tea while Hikari ponders the chessboard. She doesn't move when I set the cup down in front of her."
    hikari "I didn't know you played baseball."
    takeru "Strange, I could've sworn I mentioned it."
    takeru "Well, not any more. I was a pitcher back before I transferred here. I guess I wasn't so bad."
    hikari "Then why not play here?"
    takeru "It's... kind of a long story."
    hikari "I won't judge."
    takeru "Yes you will."
    takeru "I guess it's not like... supernatural club field expedition embarassing, just..."
    takeru "I'm not sure I'm ready to talk to anyone about it."
    hikari "It seems you don't trust me all that much."
    takeru "I..."
    "I guess Hikari and I are friendly, but..."
    "It's not like I've known her all that long. I don't know what she thinks of me, really."
    "It strikes me that if everyone else in this school consciously avoids her... that just leaves me."
    hikari "It's alright. I guess I don't trust you all that much either."
    "She stares at the incense burner on the table. Did she fetch that back down from Mana's clutches in the old library already?"
    takeru "Sorry."
    hikari "Takeru, do you think I'm real?"
    takeru "Real? Of course. It was Mana going on about ghosts and stuff last night. I know sometimes I slip up and misremember things, but..."
    hikari "Then here. Take my hand."
    takeru "Your hand?"
    "She holds it out over the table. A small, pale palm."
    "I reach out and..."
    hikari "Ha."
    "...she pulls her hand away."
    hikari "You really don't have much faith, do you?"
    takeru "Hey. You offered."
    hikari "It's fine. It's the usual."
    takeru "I don't think that really makes things better."
    "Hikari exhales. Her face draws up in frustration."
    "Finally shegestures at the chessboard. I take the cue and start setting up for a new game."
    takeru "Is this set really handmade?"
    hikari "Carved it myself."
    takeru "I didn't know you were into crafts."
    hikari "It was a long time ago. I wasn't that good, but..."
    takeru "They don't look so bad to me."
    "Each piece is made from smaller wooden parts, each sanded and painted either orange or green. The knights have a tapered cylinder for a snout and black flecks painted on the back."
    hikari "I put in the time and practice. Anything worth doing takes time and attention to detail."
    takeru "It's a shame about the missing knight then."
    hikari "We make do."
    "She doesn't look at it, but instead gestures at the thimble currently substituting for my kingside knight."
    hikari "Let's see if you have any basic openings down."
    "I take my first move, and play progresses in Hikari's curious style. She never deigns to actually touch the board and just calls her moves as I defeat myself."
    takeru "Hikari, I didn't mean it earlier. I know everyone at Mirako must..."
    hikari "Bishop A4."
    takeru "I know everyone has something against you. I'm just trying to make sure I'm not..."
    hikari "We need to start playing with a timer."
    "I pause and play into what's probably a trap."
    takeru "Sometimes it's hard for me to keep track of memory. Or even what's going on right now. It's part of why I'm at Mirako."
    takeru "So when Mana and Natsumi can introduce themselves then casually deny meeting you a day later..."
    takeru "I've started wondering if I should head back to the clinic for a while."
    hikari "..."
    "She's frustrated again. She takes her attention off the board and onto me."
    hikari "Okay, imagine this, Takeru. Something... happened. Something unpleasant happened in your past not too long ago."
    takeru "I get it."
    hikari "Something unpleasant for you, but unpleasant for everyone else involved. And there are a lot of other people involved, in their own ways. Everything's detailed."
    "My teammates could testify. I'm sure none of them would want to see me around again."
    hikari "But you're stuck. You made a bad decision. You can't just disappear, you have to talk to these people, see these people, and they have to see you over and over again forever. They just want to move on."
    "Is that how I'm remembered at Tohoku? Unremembered?"
    hikari "So when someone stumbles over a name... It means it's more painful for them to remember than it is to me that they forget. I forgive them."
    takeru "That..."
    "I always had a choice like that, right? I didn't have to come to Mirako. I could be at Tohoku right now. My classmates wouldn't hate me. They'd be polite, but... they'd just pretend I didn't exist."
    takeru "I think I understand you a little better."
    hikari "That's... a little reassuring."
    hikari "Maybe if you spend a little time down here, you'll learn."
    takeru "No, I think I get it. I'm learning you're not so - "
    hikari "You'll learn not to walk into obvious traps. Your queen is pinned by the bishop now. I can mate in two."
    "I groan and look down at the board."
    hikari "If you want to take that move back, we can walk through this again tomorrow. You just need to pay more attention."
    "Half of her smiles."
    takeru "Right. Let's try that. See your tomorrow."
    hikari "Bye, Takeru."
    "Hikari goes back to brooding over her untouched tea while I gather my things and head out into the hall."
    
    "There are still a few students filtering through the school at this point, most headed out after study or club activities."
    "I'm about to be free of this day's weirdness when I hear two voices from around the corner."
    natsumi "Well look who it is!"
    "And I'd almost escaped. Meiko and Natsumi come down the hall, Natsumi tossing a baseball up and down in one hand."
    takeru "Hi Natsumi, Meiko."
    natsumi "You stood me up, you dope."
    meiko "What?"
    takeru "I forgot, honest. I would've come if I'd remembered."
    natsumi "Hmmm..."
    natsumi "Well I guess we'll just have to try again later. There's been a change of plans so I've got to speed things up."
    "Meiko raises and eyebrow."
    natsumi "Takeru, you're on your way back to the dorms?"
    takeru "Yeah."
    natsumi "Oh, you should come with us, then. I need to grab some things then I might have to head to the hospital. One of my guys might be injured."
    meiko "Are you in a rush? I've got some papers I need to pick up from the staff office."
    natsumi "I guess I'll duck out then. You guys have fun... But next time you won't be able to escape, Takeru."
    "She turns a corner and hopefully fades from earshot."
    takeru "That was ominous."
    meiko "What were you supposed to do today?"
    takeru "I'm... not sure."
    "Although I have a pretty good idea."
    takeru "Meiko, a quick question..."
    meiko "I do have to pick up those papers. Why don't you come?"
    takeru "Alright, so..."
    "She starts off down to the administrative offices."
    takeru "You haven't gone around telling people I used to play ba - "
    takeru "Er, I mean, you haven't told people I had that sports scholarship, right?"
    meiko "No."
    "She says that but she blushes."
    meiko "That'd be a little rude of me. Natsumi is just a curious judge of character."
    takeru "I guess."
    meiko "The Mirako baseball team has a big tournament in a week or so, so she might be a little on edge."
    takeru "Oh right, I almost forgot."
    meiko "That seems to happen often."
    "I can't tell if there's malice behind her words."
    meiko "You said you'd have time to help with the festival tomorrow?"
    takeru "Probably, yeah."
    meiko "That's what I'm picking up now, actually. There are a bunch of clubs that need to be contacted for displays and problems with their applications and things like that?"
    takeru "I guess that sounds like something I could do."
    meiko "Excellent. Wait here. This should only take a minute."
    "She gestures at the door to the staff office. I lean on the wall while she enters."
    "The only window in this hall is a small one in the corner. The hill outside is covered in loose foliage that drifts in the breeze."
    "Somewhere down there is the town proper."
    "And past that?"
    "But I start paying attention to the room behind me again when I start hearing voices."
    meiko "Thanks, ma'am... We should be able to handle it."
    staff "I'm glad the council has been so on top of things. We've really left it up to you this year."
    meiko "Well, the festival is a student celebration, right?"
    staff "But you should keep Mirako's traditions in mind too."
    meiko "Considering the circumstances..."
    staff "You're really sure about skipping the fireworks this year?"
    meiko "I know it's important to Mirako but it'd be, well..."
    staff "No, I understand. It's your call to make."
    "Wait, hang on? Whose call to make?"
    staff "We'll respect your decision."
    meiko "Thanks for your confidence. We'll put on a good festival this year with or without fireworks. And I'll take care of this paperwork."
    staff "Thank you again Meiko."
    "The girl in question emerges from the staff room, the same ineffable smile on her face."
    "I join her and we walk back towards the school gates."
    meiko "Sorry to keep you waiting."
    takeru "No problem."
    "She's shuffling through the forms in her hands and eventually hands off half to me."
    meiko "You're still fine with helping? I can handle this myself, probaly, if you..."
    takeru "I've got a debt to make up here."
    meiko "I beg to differ, but, thanks. Anyway, you can see those are either budget requests or else display applications. We've tried to circle what's wrong, and there's a person you should be able to get in touch with up top..."
    "But I find it hard to focus on her explanations with another question on my mind."
    "Finally, when we pass off of school grounds and start on the road home, I work up the nerve to ask it."
    takeru "Hey Meiko..."
    meiko "What's on your mind?"
    takeru "Fireworks."
    "She misses a step."
    meiko "What about them?"
    takeru "I thought I heard there was some something the administration said that meant no fireworks this year. After a fire last year or something they put their foot down."
    meiko "That's right."
    takeru "..."
    meiko "...You must've overheard. Didn't you?"
    takeru "I probably just didn't remember what Natsumi said. That's been happening. It's up to the staff, right?"
    meiko "...I find it very difficult to lie."
    "She stops completely this time to sit on a guardrail."
    meiko "It's my decision."
    takeru "What?"
    meiko "You know the Mirako main school building caught fire last year, right? On the night of the festival."
    takeru "I'd heard something like that. So they remodeled."
    meiko "It wasn't related to fireworks, really. It was a lantern fire, really. It was..."
    "There's something in her face I'd only seen glimpses of before. Anger? Something ugly."
    meiko "How are we supposed to celebrate with fireworks? No one wants to talk about it, but..."
    meiko "There were two students caught in that fire. It wasn't anything too serious in the ends, but, after smoke inhalation, complications..."
    meiko "We lost someone last year. They died."
    "There's something in my throat."
    "Meiko doesn't want to make eye contact and she doesn't seem to know what to say, but she keeps looking around like she isn't finished."
    "Finally she rises. We rejoin the road."
    meiko "It feels wrong. Just going on same as last year. What's so great about this place anyway that we should..."
    takeru "What was their name?"
    meiko "Who?"
    takeru "They died after getting caught up in the fire."
    "Meiko shudders. In a way I already know what she'll say."
    meiko "Her name was Hikari."
    

label day07:

    "I can't sleep."
    "It has to be two hours before my alarm or Kenta would wake me up."
    "While the embalmed frogs (two of them now) aren't doing me any favors, I know the real reason I can't get any rest. There's too much going on inside my head."
    "There's a subtle feeling that something is fundamentally wrong."
    "That Hikari is wrong."
    "That I shouldn't know her name, shouldn't talk to her, and even less be able to see her every day."
    "But that's not right, is it?"
    "I roll over in bed again. On top of the dresser, a dead frog returns my distant stare."
    "Basically, the way I see it, there's only one way anything makes sense."
    "My grip on reality could be even more fragile than I thought, but unless Meiko, Mana, Natsumi and the rest are lying to me in some sort of warped vendetta..."
    "I think I know Hikari's secret."
    "I don't know why I'm allowed to know it, but I know it, and so now I can't sleep."
    takeru "This is awful."
    "Of course the only reply is a snore from Kenta."
    takeru "Guess there's no helping it."
    "With a yawn, I pull myself out from under the blanket. A hint of sun finds its way in through the window."
    "By the time I've showered, eaten, and struggled through Kenta's clothing schemes to dress myself, it's still almost dark out."
    "While I could stew in the dorm for another hour or so, I don't think anything will help but fresh air. And maybe some answers at Mirako."
    "I'm almost out the door before I take a glance back at Kenta, still passed out on his side of the room."
    "If I don't want to deal with the patented wrath of Kenta later, I'd better write him a note."
    "That done, I start up the hill to Mirako."
    "It's quiet compared to what I'm used to. No people. No cars in the town below. Even the wind seems to have died down today. It's chilly. And also eerie."
    takeru "Kind of fitting..."
    "There are one or two students around the front gate when I enter, but it's even too early for those who come here for early practices."
    "Homeroom is deserted."
    "I take my seat but I feel like an idiot. Nobody will be here for another hour at least."
    "Maybe I should've just stayed outside and wandered around a bit, but there's something strange in the air and my mind is blank. This isn't happening."
    "What I really want to do is talk this over with someone, but there's no guarantee anyone will have any idea what I'm talking about. And it's not like anyone's around anyway."
    "Well... Except for the girl in question herself."
    
    "The old wing is familiar by this point, and it's almost indistinguishable from normal. Most people avoid this hallway if they can."
    "Everyone except for her, of course."
    "I slide open the door to an even more shadowy tearoom than normal. With only the sunrise filtered through the curtains, the atmosphere is suitably supernatural."
    takeru "Hikari. Are you here?"
    hikari "I usually am."
    "I almost missed her, sitting in front of an open book, crosslegged, perfect posture."
    hikari "Good morning. You're here early. Not that I mind too much."
    takeru "I hope I didn't interrupt anything important."
    hikari "No."
    takeru "I woke up at some awful hour and couldn't get back to sleep. So... now I'm here."
    takeru "There's just a lot on my mind."
    hikari "Some tea might help."
    takeru "That seems to be your solution for a lot of things."
    hikari "It usually is."
    takeru "Fair enough."
    "By the time I have the tea boiling, more light reaches into the room. The chessboard remains untouched from yesterday. Each piece casts a faint shadow."
    "Hikari accepts her tea wordlessly, still focused on her book."
    "Trying to calm myself now, I sit down."
    takeru "What're you reading?"
    hikari "Just some folktales. It's a collection, nothing much."
    takeru "Right."
    hikari "Are you here to work through yesterday's game? With a bit more attention, and if you escape the trap, you should have a pretty good position. How about it?"
    takeru "Maybe not. There's something else."
    takeru "I heard something strange from Meiko. Do you know her?"
    "The pause before she answers is too long."
    hikari "Yes."
    takeru "She said..."
    takeru "Last year's festival, there was some sort of accident. A fire."
    hikari "..."
    hikari "Maybe we should talk about something else."
    "I've seen Hikari distant, I've seen her bitter, and once in a while with warmth in her eyes. But never fearful. Her pupils dilate."
    takeru "Sorry, I just need someone to clear this up. I was up all night and I think I'm going crazy."
    takeru "She said someone died. A student, called Hikari."
    takeru "That... Was that you?"
    takeru "You, you aren't here, right? Like, you're here, but, you're..."
    takeru "Was it you that died that day?"
    "I expect her to call me crazy. Either that or vanish on the spot. When neither happens, I start thinking I'll probably wake up back in the clinic and it'll be April. Or I've been sleepwalking and Kenta will punch me in the forehead right about now."
    "Instead Hikari seems lost in her tea."
    hikari "Why don't we go back to chess."
    takeru "What?"
    hikari "You go over your next move. I'll... take some time and think of mine."
    "I think my heartrate is too high to concentrate on the board, but if she wants, I'll give it a try."
    "Even after a minute of thinking over my position, I can still feel the adrenaline."
    "What's she thinking about? Why am I so nervous?"
    "At least the game is a distraction. The trap isn't all that hard to spot. As long as I don't make the wrong choice, my king won't end up cornered. There's a clear way out."
    "Is it the same for Hikari? Have I inadvertently threatened her?"
    hikari "Okay."
    takeru "You're ready?"
    hikari "Do you trust me?"
    takeru "I'm not sure."
    "I try for honesty."
    takeru "Something is lying to me. Either it's you, Meiko and Natsumi, or else it's my brain lying to me."
    takeru "I really want to trust you. I want to give it a shot."
    hikari "Take my hand then."
    "Same as last time she holds it out over the board. Horizontal, not like a handshake, palm up."
    "This time though, she doesn't withdraw."
    "I hold her hand."
    "It's cold."
    "Not cold like I've grabbed a handful of snow, but cool, like I've grabbed a handful of nothing."
    "Then... I realize I have grabbed nothing. There is nothing between my fingers. Hikari's eyes are closed, her hand outstretched, but I cannot touch her and she is somewhere else entirely."
    "She is not of this world."
    hikari "You see how it is, isn't it?"
    takeru "I-I don't understand."
    hikari "You might've missed some details but you understood before you even came in."
    hikari "It was me that died that day, most likely."
    hikari "Don't ask why I'm still here."
    "She chokes on air."
    "She strikes me now as more distant, more alien than ever before."
    hikari "Why don't you make your move?"
    takeru "There. I'm moving the king this time. Done."
    hikari "Hikari died from complications from a fire at Mirako's annual festival. And I'm Hikari, stuck here now."
    hikari "Your friend Mana would call me a ghost, right?"
    hikari "Bishop. B3."
    takeru "Done."
    hikari "I'm not sure how much anyone else can see me. All the other students remember who I was as a student, to some extent. They talk to me. They go through the motions."
    hikari "Then the next day it's as if I never existed and I vanished almost a year ago."
    hikari "Since you've come to Mirako, you've met what, how many people? Friendly people, right?"
    takeru "That's right. And it's your move."
    hikari "Building relationships with other people is what it means to be alive. I guess I really must be dead because I can't even do that. I have a day, even less, and then it's all reset to zero."
    takeru "Then how are we talking now?"
    hikari "One of life's mysteries I guess. Maybe you'll find the answer if you go walking around with robes and incense, but I don't think so."
    hikari "You never knew me in life, and you said you had... some condition."
    takeru "Schizophrenia."
    hikari "That does make things complicated."
    "She thinks for a moment. I'm about to reply when she gestures at the board for me to move a piece."
    hikari "Do you believe me?"
    takeru "I do."
    hikari "You believe that I'm here, now, and you're talking to me, and not something you're imagining inside your head?"
    takeru "I do."
    hikari "I'm relieved. I really am. You can't imagine how much it means."
    "Hikari stands up and stretches, beaming. I think it's the most expressive movement I've ever seen out of her."
    hikari "Ever since you came back that second day I've been terrified you'd forget. You'd forget, or you'd never come back."
    hikari "Now..."
    "She sits back down and breathes in."
    hikari "I don't want to impose on you. If that was overwhelming I'm sorry."
    takeru "That's fine. I mean, I'm overwhelmed, but, you shouldn't be sorry."
    hikari "No, I mean, for me, I've been stuck in a circle for year, and then... you, for you I'm one person, if you see."
    hikari "Never mind. That doesn't matter now. What matters now is you know the truth."
    "The strangest truth I've heard, but I've committed to believing it. There's no turning back."
    takeru "Thanks for being honest with me. I'm still trying to piece some things together, but..."
    takeru "At least I know I'm not going crazy."
    hikari "We can only hope."
    hikari "It's your move, by the way."
    "I look down at the board."
    takeru "Well... I don't have any moves left."
    hikari "You..."
    takeru "That should mean..."
    hikari "It's a draw. Well done."
    "While I can't come close to actually winning anything, at least I've managed to eke out something that's not a loss by hiding in a corner. It's the first time yet I haven't lost horribly to Hikari."
    takeru "I guess it's a start."
    hikari "Everything has to start somewhere, right? This is a good beginning. It's worth building on."
    hikari "I can't force you to do anything, but, if you could keep visiting here, even only a bit..."
    takeru "I'm pretty sure I'm down here daily anyway."
    hikari "While you've seen it means a lot to me."
    takeru "Do you ever leave the tearoom?"
    hikari "You've seen me around. I go where I want, but it seems that I only ever want to be here. It's quiet. Nobody's ever here."
    hikari "Maybe I'll make an effort."
    takeru "An effort?"
    hikari "Forget it, it's not important right now."
    hikari "Don't you have class?"
    takeru "Ah, dammit, almost forgot. I don't want to run, but..."
    hikari "I'll see you later, I hope."
    takeru "I'll be back. Have a little faith in me."
    "She walks me to the door."
    "I leave with almost as many questions as when I entered, but..."
    "Somehow things seem more orderly. Or have at least taken a step in that direction."
    
    "As expected, I barely make to class on time. In fact, the only person later than me is Natsumi."
    "While I feel like I could've spent another hour or two in the old wing, at least I don't have to suffer the embarassment of showing up after Natsumi again, (or deal with her smugness either)."
    "As classes start my focus isn't strong."
    "My mind isn't knotted and disjointed like this morning, but it still seems like there's something more important than schoolwork right now."
    "Plus I now have yet another tic setting me apart from my classmates. They've lost a classmate, and I've gained one. Does that give some responsibility to her?"
    "I can't imagine what it'd be to live a loop like that, where one day to the next, no one remembered and no one cared."
    "Thinking back to that first day, no wonder she was so dismissive."
    natsumi "Psst."
    takeru "Oh what do you want?"
    natsumi "Public service announcement. It's lunchtime. You can get up now."
    takeru "What? Oh."
    "She's not lying. Half the class is out the door, and the other half is Natsumi's crew. She crosses the room to join them."
    "Time for lunch."
    "At the doorway, I'm trying to decide to think if I should mention Hikari to Mana or Hagami when I hear a familiar voice. Two familiar voices, actually. Arguing?"
    kenta "...so that's not how it's supposed to work. I'm perfectly willing to talk to her, but..."
    meiko "What's her name?"
    kenta "How should I know?"
    meiko "You have to work on this, Kenta. You were getting better last year, right?"
    kenta "Fine, fine. I still shouldn't have to remember her name to work with her though."
    meiko "Oh, hey Takeru. Over here."
    "Meiko waves me over to the corner of the hall, where Kenta stands with his arms crossed."
    kenta "Good afternoon, Takeru."
    takeru "Good afternoon, Kenta. Hey Meiko."
    takeru "What's going on?"
    kenta "I have an uncooperative lab partner. Meiko used to help with these things last year, but..."
    meiko "I'll see what I can do. Point her out sometime, okay?"
    kenta "Fine."
    meiko "I'm sorry I can't do more but I've been a bit overwhelmed with festival work this year. It's really close."
    meiko "Speaking of which... Have you made a start on contacting the people on those forms, Takeru?"
    takeru "What? Er..."
    "Honestly I'd forgotten they existed. And didn't I just get them yesterday?"
    takeru "No, I haven't. I'll get on that."
    takeru "When should these be done?"
    meiko "By the end of the week, we'll need everyone updated info. Let me know if you need help."
    takeru "I don't think I can ask for help in the process of helping you out, can I?"
    kenta "Everyone goes to Meiko for help, so it's the usual."
    "Meiko laughs without any sign of unease."
    "Our group seems to have attracted someone else's attention as well."
    natsumi "Well, hey everyone. How's it going, Kenta?"
    kenta "Good afternoon. Who are you?"
    natsumi "I'm Natsumi, you dope. We're friends, remember?"
    kenta "No, not really."
    natsumi "You always remember Meiko's name."
    "Meiko maintains her smile while Natsumi pouts at her."
    kenta "I'll be late for lunch, so I'm going now. Bye."
    natsumi "I didn't know you could be late to lunch like you could be late to class..."
    takeru "For Kenta you could be late to anything."
    natsumi "I like that guy."
    takeru "Baffling."
    meiko "Anyway, Takeru, if you don't know how to get in touch with someone listed there, come find me. Their class should be listed with their name so you'll know where to start."
    takeru "Got it."
    "I guess I didn't realize the job I'd signed up for involved hunting down random students. I'll recognize no one, no doubt."
    meiko "I have a meeting to get to, so I'll leave you to enjoy your lunch. See you later."
    natsumi "Seeya Meiko."
    "Meiko waves as she turns and heads toward the front gates. Natsumi returns the gesture with a salute."
    natsumi "That's Meiko for you. Always caught between helping people out and organizing a million things."
    "There's no sarcasm to it. Somehow our school idol baseball captain looks up to her."
    natsumi "She should be a CEO instead of lawyer. Too boring for her."
    takeru "That's really her plan, is it?"
    natsumi "Yep. If she survives the school festival, that is. Who knows how she wound up with all that responsibility."
    natsumi "Good thing she's got you to back her up, right?"
    takeru "I just do the grunt work."
    "But by the way Natsumi's elbowing me and raising her eyebrows, that's probably not what she meant."
    takeru "We've just known each other a while is all."
    natsumi "Whatever. Actually..."
    "I don't like that look."
    natsumi "I've got an offer to make."
    takeru "An offer? What?"
    natsumi "I've got something to show you, so, come back in here."
    "She points to the now empty classroom. I follow her in, but I'm regretting I didn't slip away while Meiko and Kenta still had me covered."
    takeru "Is this going to take a while? I was sort of planning to meet some people for lunch."
    natsumi "Oh, me too, don't worry. Let me just find this..."
    "From her bag, she pulls out a spiralbound book with thick, glossy cover pages. It's a deep blue trimmed with gold, and front on the cover is a picture of..."
    "Tohoku High School."
    "She rifles through the pages. Snapshots of baseball players flip past, some posing, some with groups. On the opposite page is a table filled with numbers and decimal points."
    "It's a yearbook of sorts: the baseball yearbook, the only one that matters there."
    "Each player has a dedicated page with their yearly averages, record, and any other relevant stats, almost as detailed as the majors."
    "She stops about halfway through. It's the pitching pages. This particular pitcher only posted two losses the entire season. A fastball speed that reaches the high 70s. His ERA is listed. Best in the school."
    "And only a freshman, too. He'll be unstoppable as a senior."
    "The young man in the portrait is grinning. He's confident. His hat is pulled low over his face as he gives a thumbs up to the camera."
    "Natsumi takes her index finger at jams the name at the top of the profile a few times and says it aloud, as if I had any trouble reading."
    natsumi "Ichiro. Takeru."
    takeru "W-Where did you get this?"
    natsumi "I want this guy on my baseball team."
    takeru "That's not me."
    natsumi "You're not this goofy guy in the picture? Is he your twin or something? A clone?"
    takeru "He's not me any more."
    "Natsumi waves her hand to clear away confusion."
    natsumi "Okay, okay. You probably don't want to play for some backwater team like Mirako's, but there's a tournament coming up. Baseball's the only sport we're competitive in. It means something around here to us, anyway."
    takeru "It's not that... I don't think I'm better than you all, I - "
    natsumi "Hiyama was our ace in the hole. It's a five game series and I had him up for games one and five, but he broke two fingers yesterday and there's no way he's going to be ready to go in time."
    natsumi "You just need to pitch those two games. Then you're done. You can play with us or no, I just need one more guy to wrap up this season."
    takeru "You don't want me on your team. Trust me you don't want me pitching. I haven't touched a baseball in months and I'm worried - "
    takeru "I don't think I have to explain this to you. See you later, Natsumi."
    natsumi "Takeru, wait up!"
    "But as I leave the room and brush through the crowd in the hall, she stops following at the doorway."
    "Her mouth is scrunched up and she's clutching that terrible Tohoku yearbook to her chest."
    "How long has she had that?"
    "I have no idea where she got the thing, but I'd be happier if all copies were burned. It wasn't a lie when I said that kid in the picture wasn't me any more."
    
    "I wind up at the old library, but I hesitate outside the door."
    "Mana and Hagami will calm me down after Natsumi's bizarre offer, I'm sure, but I don't want to talk about Hikari to them at this point. I still haven't decided how to broach that particular subject."
    "Plus the door is closed today. Odd."
    "I open it and enter to a familiar scene, but just missing a detail."
    takeru "Hi Hagami. Where's Mana?"
    "She shrugs and returns to her book."
    takeru "Looks like it's just me and you today."
    hagami "Oh well."
    takeru "Please, I'm not that terrible."
    "Hagami laughs. I'm a bit relieved that was a joke."
    "I start unpacking my lunch, and Hagami clears away some books for me to set my things down."
    "The radio's up louder than usual. Whatever's playing is currently between orchestral pieces and someone's providing commentary in German. I still don't think I understand Hagami."
    "Thinking back, we haven't really eaten together without Mana since that very first day, where Hagami practically fled the room."
    "At least now it looks like I've been downgraded from a threat to a minor friendly presence. Like, maybe a housecat or something."
    "I start eating, but even so, I feel uneasy."
    "It's probably normal for Hagami, but even a few minutes of silence alone with somebody feels uncomfortable."
    takeru "Read anything interesting lately?"
    "Even asking seems stupid."
    hagami "Not really."
    "She flips up her book to show me the title. It's new from her usual genre. It appears to be some kind of medical manual."
    takeru "'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems?'"
    takeru "That seems a little morbid. What're you - "
    "I glance at the header at the top of the current page. Psychiatry. Then... Schizophrenia?"
    takeru "What're you up to, anyway?"
    "She must've caught my glance because she flips half the manual forward and arrives at the section on corneal ulcers."
    hagami "Just the usual."
    "But she blushes, then adjusts a knob on the radio."
    "After a few moments, she seems to have a change of heart and dials it down again. The German narrator fades to a whisper."
    hagami "Thanks for going on the field expedition with Mana."
    takeru "If I remember, a certain someone set me up for that."
    "But she doesn't appear to be joking around. She continues in a monotone."
    hagami "We used to both go. Once this year Just... something we could both relate to."
    hagami "She..."
    hagami "I don't what she believes or not, but last year... Some unhappy things happened at Mirako."
    hagami "It's best to be respectful."
    takeru "I think I understand. She's a freshman, so she wouldn't know anything about the fire last year."
    hagami "Hm."
    "Hagami nods. She seems a bit surprised I was aware, but otherwise it doesn't look like she feels too strongly about it one way or the other."
    "I wonder what last year would've been like for Hagami, without Mana around constantly. It doesn't seem like something I should talk about."
    takeru "When did you meet Mana? It seems crazy it was less than a year ago."
    hagami "It wasn't."
    takeru "What?"
    hagami "Middle school."
    takeru "Oh. Right. I'm sure she was even more off the walls then."
    hagami "Not really. She was quieter."
    "Hagami looks up from the pages of her disease book and glances at the stack of paperbacks next to me. They're all titled some number variant of \"Sayaka's Rose-colored Days at Phantom High.\""
    hagami "And I was the one reading those."
    hagami "I've moved on to more important knowledge."
    "...and she raises her own book. I can't tell if she's joking."
    takeru "I think I'd rather hit myself in the head with that thing than read it."
    "She squints at me. Not joking."
    "But Hagami looks back down and the radio goes up in volume again."
    "I finish my lunch. While I don't think I'll ever get used to Hagami's near silence, I'm starting to realize she does compliment Mana well, who never fails to fill any dead air with chatter."
    "I'm missing her now."
    "Hagami continues to thumb through her medical book with her eyes closed. I won't question whatever black magic lets her absorb information off the page."
    "With nothing else to do to make myself busy, I pull out the rejected applications that Meiko assigned me."
    "Most of these look pretty simple. I spot one right away where the genius volleyball team managed to misspell his club name on the form. Yumi on the swim team didn't provide any info on her budget requests."
    "Of course I hardly know any of these people, so tracking them down will be an exercise in pain. I'm not looking forward to finding the class rep for all of these other classes and putting faces to names."
    "When I look up, Hagami's book is shut, but she's still staring at it, probably boring a hole all the way through to the table."
    "She speaks without moving."
    hagami "What... was it you saw?"
    takeru "What did I see? Oh, this is just festival paperwork. I'm trying to help a friend, but it - "
    hagami "Two nights ago."
    takeru "Oh. You're talking about... that thing from ten minutes ago."
    hagami "Yes?"
    "She squints at me again."
    takeru "We just met my friend Hikari. That's really all it was."
    hagami "Hm."
    "Although that meeting has a different meaning given what I know now. And I certainly don't want to go over this with Hagami right now."
    "...Then again, there's probably no one in a better position to understand than her."
    hagami "I thought you might say something different with Mana gone. I'm glad you didn't."
    "She opens the book again (with a table-shaking thud) and this time goes back to actually reading it."
    "I'll write this off as some quirk of Hagami I guess. Time to get back to sorting through these forms."
    "Is there anyone in this pile I actually know? I think this guy's in my class. No clue on her. Or her."
    "I know a Hagami, obviously, but this probably isn't her applying for a performance slot. Wait, hang on. Affiliation: supernatural club."
    "I glance up to where Hagami is reading. She's slouched over, arms crossed on the table and head resting on top of them, focused on the book a few inches away."
    "While I look back and forth between her and the form, she turns another page, then looks up."
    hagami "Are you alright?"
    takeru "Hang on..."
    takeru "Did you apply for anything at the festival? This form's got your name on it. Is someone trying to prank you or something?"
    "If I thought she was blushing earlier, it's nothing compared to this."
    hagami "It's a mistake."
    takeru "There's not really anything on here, except for name, club, and class and all that. What're you even applying for? Looks like Meiko attacked this whole form with a red highlighter."
    hagami "Just ignore it. Throw it out."
    takeru "I can do that... I guess."
    "I could tear it up or hand it back to her, but something compels me to just put it at the bottom of the pile for now."
    "Hagami's sitting upright now and she's been halfway through flipping a page for the past ten seconds or so."
    hagami "Do you mind... not telling Mana about that?"
    takeru "No problem."
    hagami "I changed my mind. I'd be embarassed if she..."
    takeru "It's fine, really."
    "I'm actually kind of surprised she didn't deny she ever filed it. It seems like that'd be easier."
    "Or is she trying to signal me in on something?"
    "But all Hagami does is give a faint smile of approval and head back down to that disease compendium that's currently bending the table."
    "I shuffle through the papers again and try to put together a list of who needs to be contacted about what."
    "I can't seem to do it any more than halfheartedly though. The prospect of facing Natsumi in class after lunch isn't very appealing. I don't know why I still have reservations about Hikari either. Everything seemed so simple a few hours ago."
    "And of course I have Meiko to deal with."
    "Wait, \"deal with?\" Why am I apprehensive? She's been nothing but kind to me since I've gotten here and she's probably the biggest reason I've managed to fit in at all."
    hagami "One moment."
    "At first I'm confused as to what she's talking about, but then I realize the radio is silent. Hagami taps a button and a CD ejects from a slot below the dials."
    "Weird. The thing looks like an antique, but it must just be built that way. And I thought it was actually playing a broadcast from the most boring radio station imaginable."
    "Hagami searches a top shelf where I notice a row of disc cases. Looks like the supernatural club has thoroughly stocked the old library."
    "After retrieving a CD, she picks an enormous textbook off the shelf, returns, and inserts the disc."
    hagami "That's better. Sorry for the wait."
    "It's indistinguishable from whatever was on before. There's even some German guy with an intro before the tinny choir starts up."
    "...Did she actually think I was paying attention to this?"
    takeru "Oh, don't be sorry, I wasn't really..."
    hagami "...?"
    takeru "It's all the same to me."
    "Hagami immediately takes the textbook she brought back and drops it in front of me. I nearly jump out of my seat."
    hagami "You should know the basics."
    "The tract in front of me is titled \"A Brief Overview of Modern Musical Trends.\" It seems to date from the prewar era and have over a thousand pages."
    "No way. She can't expect me to be interested in this. A joke?"
    hagami "..."
    "All I get is a deadpan stare, but... I'm trapped."
    "If I laugh at this I might offend her. If I start reading this thing I will look like an idiot."
    "She's still staring. I swear dust is still drifting off the shelves from the book's impact."
    takeru "Very funny but I think I've fallen for this before."
    hagami "That's... Handel is playing."
    hagami "His masses have gotten me through some bad times, I just thought... Maybe..."
    takeru "Er, sorry, I must've misunderstood. Lunch is almost over but I guess I'll check it out when - "
    "She's snickering."
    takeru "You're absolutely shameless. See you, Hagami, I'm headed to class."
    "She suppresses a giggle long enough to reply."
    hagami "Later."
    
    "I'm back at my desk before Natsumi, unsurprisingly. Meiko, of course, is already there."
    "While I'm still trying to consider whether to ask her what I should do about Natsumi, or even asking where Natsumi got that stupid yearbook, the girl in question enters and rejoins us with a wave."
    "I have no idea how my sudden walkout came across to her. Rude? Crazy? At least I hope it was clear it was final. I'd rather not hurt her feelings over this but it's a price I'll pay if I need to."
    "But she just grins."
    natsumi "Hey Takeru, Meiko. Hope I didn't miss anything."
    meiko "No. You're lucky today. You need to make an effort to get here on time in the afternoon, not just in the morning."
    natsumi "Effort, effort, effort..."
    "She leans back in her seat."
    natsumi "Maybe later."
    "And luckily for me, Natsumi seems content to zone out for most of afternoon classes."
    "I can't concentrate much myself, but I'm more relieved I don't have to deal with her constant ribbing."
    "Finally, the end of the day arrives."
    "Just when I think it's possible Natsumi took the hint realized enough is enough, I'm caught on the way out of the room."
    natsumi "Hey Takeru!"
    takeru "Hi."
    natsumi "You're awfully quiet today, you know? Anyway, about earlier..."
    "Please, be an apology..."
    natsumi "My offer's still on the table. So, let me know your final decision! Anyway, I've got practice. See you!"
    "She gives a wink and without even waiting for my final decision hightails it down the hall. I watch her back for a few minutes before I realize Meiko is next to me."
    meiko "She's been a little odd lately."
    takeru "You could fool me. She's persistent."
    meiko "She does work hard you know. In her own way."
    takeru "Well she's working at the wrong things. You know that tournament coming up? She's..."
    "I'm trying to think how I should frame this when Meiko glances over her shoulder."
    meiko "Sorry, I'd love to hear about, but I need to hurry to a council meeting. Catch me tomorrow, alright?"
    takeru "Right. Bye, then."
    "I'm left in an empty classroom."
    "I open the window, but the air outside is still calm. I hardly get a breeze. At least the chatter coming from outside on the path is nice."
    "This is normally when I'd think about heading down to the old wing to try and find Hikari. I don't know why I don't go now."
    "After this morning, I thought everything had become clear. Now I'm almost more confused."
    "That conversation definitely happened, right? Where Hikari said she was... already dead. Just not passed on. A ghost?"
    "I should just calm down, go downstairs, and make some tea."
    "Instead I pull out the stack of papers from Meiko. There's probably only about a dozen festival applications here, but it takes me longer than it should to put together the list of names and classes."
    "I make an editorial decision to leave Hagami's bizarre blank form off the list. She must've filed it by mistake or something."
    "Bu even when I'm finished work, I just sit at my desk. At least a breeze picked up. When I rise to shut the window, I note it's noticeably cooler out."
    "I'll just go home and get some work done."
    takeru "Ah! Sorry Hagami."
    "I practically walk into her as I take a left coming out of the classroom."
    hagami "Takeru."
    "She's stonyfaced again and ignores my almost crashing into her."
    takeru "What's up? Have you been waiting there?"
    hagami "...I wasn't sure you were alone in there."
    takeru "Just killing time I guess. Did you need something?"
    hagami "Do still have it?"
    takeru "What?"
    hagami "My form."
    takeru "Oh. I guess?"
    "I shuffle through my things and pull out Hagami's virtually blank festival request. Meiko's red marker is visible through the back of the page."
    takeru "This is the one, right?"
    "She nods and takes it from me. Good thing I didn't toss it out at lunch then, although she might as well just start another form entirely. What did she think she'd accomplish by submitting a blank form?"
    hagami "Thanks."
    hagami "And... You're not telling Mana, right?"
    takeru "I can do that, I guess. I just don't get why..."
    "But Hagami is half turned around. She's checked out."
    takeru "I won't it bring it up with Mana."
    hagami "Thanks Takeru. Bye."
    "And she heads off down the hall, back towards the old wing. She has a stiff walk, holding her neck stiff, as if she knows I'm watching."
    "Hagami has always been so strange to me that I've never wondered why, exactly, she's at Mirako."
    "Only now I realize how strange it is that despite eating lunch with her for almost a month, I still know practically nothing about her."
    "She turns a corner and disappears."
    
    "For some reason I pause at school doors. My dorm isn't so far away now and I can put this wash of a day behind me."
    "I push open the door, but from behind, someone calls my name."
    meiko "Oh, you're still here. Hello Takeru."
    takeru "Hey Meiko. You're done with your meeting?"
    meiko "Mhm. It's normally not this busy with the student council and all, but, you know, with everything coming up..."
    "She raises her head up and brushes back her hair with one hand."
    meiko "I've got to do my part. Can't let you all down, right?"
    takeru "Right."
    meiko "How are things going? You always seem to be around late. Found a club?"
    takeru "No. There's just nothing for me to do back at my room anyway, but... I'm on my way back to the dorms now, anyway."
    meiko "Care to walk with me again? I'm headed down to Mirako, but you'd be good company before then."
    takeru "Sounds good."
    "We cross the school ground in silence and pass the main gate."
    "I was going to bring up Natsumi's recruiting pitch, but I can't think of a good way to phrase it. What's wrong with her asking me if I want to join the baseball team? I can't exactly tell her to leave me alone without explaining myself."
    "And I'm pretty sure I lied to Meiko about my final days at Tohoku anyway."
    meiko "That's too bad you haven't found a club yet, you know. Or some team or other. I know when I first came to Mirako, joining the student council helped me out a lot."
    takeru "I hang out with some people, I guess."
    "I'm pretty sure Mana and Hagami alone don't make up an actual club though."
    takeru "Probably doesn't stack up to the student council though."
    meiko "Well, it's what you make of it. I'm interested in student leadership and the council gave me that opportunity. Just make the most of things."
    takeru "I'm trying."
    "Would Meiko be encouraging me to join up with Natsumi's team?"
    meiko "Hey..."
    takeru "Hm?"
    meiko "I know Natsumi might be acting a little strange with her tournament coming up. Try to cut her some slack, okay?"
    takeru "Er..."
    meiko "She, well, may have found out you used to go to Tohoku. It's a famous school, you know. You should be more proud. I was sure proud for you when I found out that's where you'd gone."
    meiko "Don't let her push you into something."
    "I guess Meiko did know after all. Turns out I was dumb for not just speaking up."
    takeru "She did ask me to join the baseball team for a few games, but..."
    meiko "Just remember you don't have to do anything you're uncomfortable with, alright?"
    takeru "Thanks."
    "Wait, \"uncomfortable with?\" I thought I told her I just faded out of baseball at Tohoku."
    "Whatever. She's being helpful anyway."
    meiko "If you need me to talk to her..."
    takeru "I'm fine. You've got enough on your plate already, sounds like."
    "She laughs, as if she's proud of it."
    meiko "You could say that."
    meiko "Having you to help out with some of this does relieve me a little bit, though."
    takeru "I'll just try not to slow you down."
    "As the festival comes up again, and I realize I'm still not very comfortable with Meiko's little deception."
    "Why do the fireworks matter that much? Why not just tell the class that it's her decision, and not something handed down from the staff? It wouldn't make a difference, would it?"
    "It was this spot yesterday she was talking about it. I decide not to bring it up."
    "We come to the bend and fork that marks where the road splits off to town and to the Mirako dorms."
    meiko "Thanks for walking with me. I'll see you later, Takeru."
    takeru "Bye."
    "She nods in acknowledgment, then starts off down the road without a backwards look."
    "I stand in place a for a few moments."
    "For whatever reason I can't shake the feeling she's on guard around me. Sometimes, when she's giving advice or helping others, talking to her is effortless. It's genuine."
    "And then sometimes it feels like something's unwell. Has there been a day this week she hasn't been busy during lunch, after class, and then in the evening as well?"
    "It's when she's talking about the festival, and all the festival work, that I feel like I'm talking to that old, timid Meiko I knew in middle school, just pretending to be the confident model student here today."
    "Or maybe it's just my memory shaping my perception."
    "That seems to be happening too much these days."
    

label day08:

    "I arrive at Mirako early again today, this time with Kenta in tow."
    "It's a crisp day. In a few weeks it'll probably be too cold to hang around outside in the morning like this. Today, though, it's pleasant break form the humidity of yesterday."
    "Traffic along the road up the hill starts to pick up. The familiar chatter of students on their commute doesn't work to take my mind off anything, though."
    "Maybe work will. Armed with my list of students and half-complete forms, I'll try to contact at least a few people before classes start."
    takeru "Hey Kenta. This guy's in 3A. Do you know him? He didn't put in any details for his budget request. Name's Suzuki."
    kenta "Never heard of him."
    takeru "Alright... Do you know who the class rep is for 3A?"
    kenta "I've never needed to know that."
    takeru "I was afraid of this..."
    "We're seated at one of the picnic tables out front of Mirako. Kenta is paging through a math textbook while I scribble next to the names on my contact list and wonder if I could've chosen a less helpful partner for this job."
    takeru "Do you really know nobody at this school?"
    kenta "I know everyone I need to know."
    takeru "Wish I could say that."
    takeru "Plus half the people I know I almost wish I didn't."
    "Here's to you, Natsumi."
    kenta "See? Being well-connected isn't everything. My frogs are only there when I want them to be, and they talk me into... What exactly is it you're doing anyway?"
    takeru "Stuff for the festival. And don't get me started about your frogs."
    "I came home yesterday afternoon to no less than five assorted amphibians in jars on my dresser. Plus one snake."
    "I'm not even sure if Kenta is the one embalming them at this point or he just has a source for dubious pickled animals. And I'm not really tempted to ask him about it."
    meiko "Good morning. You two are here early."
    takeru "Ah, hey Meiko."
    "I shuffle the papers in front of me into a pile under the list, for whatever reason."
    kenta "Good morning, Meiko."
    meiko "How are things going with your lab partner?"
    kenta "No. I don't understand what's so hard about just getting your own work done and talking to someone about it."
    meiko "Well if you can point her out, maybe I can help."
    meiko "Hm, seems it's almost time for class, isn't it?"
    "Kenta checks his watch."
    kenta "Close enough."
    kenta "Good luck on your people thing, or whatever it is, Takeru."
    "His things packed, Kenta strides off towards Mirako. Meiko waits beside me as I put the pile of forms into my bag."
    meiko "Oh, you're working on those festival application? Thank you Takeru. I appreciate it."
    meiko "Is that why you showed up early?"
    takeru "Er..."
    "For some reason I don't like that smile. She seems more cheery that I'm here at school well before I'd need to be rather than the fact that I'm trying to help her with all this paperwork."
    takeru "Pretty much. I don't know how you deal with all this."
    meiko "It's tough sometimes. But that's what I've got you for, right?"
    takeru "I guess."
    meiko "I'll count on you then. It's definitely a lot to get done, so let me know if you need any help."
    takeru "I can handle it."
    "Although this sort of thing is almost certainly better suited to her. Meiko seems to know everyone where I can barely name even my own classmates."
    "Nevertheless... I did sign up for this, right?"
    
    "I follow Meiko to homeroom."
    "Despite all my agonizing over my really simple job, I've still only managed to cross a single name off the list. Hopefully Meiko doesn't ask about it."
    "To my relief she doesn't."
    meiko "Maybe I didn't mention it when you first came to Mirako, Takeru, but Kenta's a good roommmate for you."
    takeru "Who do you even live with, anyway? Probably someone that doesn't plant dead animals in your room while you're out."
    meiko "What?"
    takeru "Nothing. I've got frog problems is all."
    meiko "You're still an entertaining person, Takeru. You know, I missed you after all these years."
    "I don't respond. Meiko throws a glance my way, not smiling."
    takeru "Er... It's been nice having you around too."
    takeru "Seems like you've changed a lot more than me though."
    "Meiko beams."
    meiko "That's for the best."
    "We enter the classroom, where, in a return to normalcy, Natsumi hasn't arrived yet."
    "Meiko takes out a page of notes as she sits down. It looks like a bunch of bullet points? Does she really have her daily talks to the class planned to that level of detail?"
    "Meanwhile after two days I've managed to talk to one person out of maybe twelve that I've been assigned."
    "Almost as soon as Meiko gets up to address the class, Natsumi slips in and into the desk next to mine."
    natsumi "Morning, Takeru."
    takeru "Oh. Hi."
    natsumi "You look kind of grim. Not enough sleep last night?"
    takeru "I slept fine, thanks."
    "She pokes me in the shoulder."
    natsumi "So. Any status updates?"
    takeru "No."
    natsumi "Hmm..."
    "Natsumi gives me a sly grin as Meiko says something about exam results at the front of the room."
    natsumi "I know. You must've been tossing and turning all night thinking about my offer, right?"
    takeru "No."
    "Truth be told I didn't sleep great. Better than last night, when Hikari's question kept me up, but it seems things keep piling on day after day."
    "And Natsumi isn't exactly helping."
    natsumi "Too bad, too bad."
    natsumi "Y'know, I spent a lot of time scouting you. From day one."
    takeru "What? Scouting? Doesn't that involve... Actually watching someone play b-baseball?"
    natsumi "Aha. That's where you're wrong!"
    "I've definitely walked into a trap. I shouldn't have engaged. Now all that's left is to listen to Natsumi whispering as she leans across her desk."
    natsumi "Mirako's never had that great a team. I pretty much had to recruit everyone myself this year. Anyone with experience, I found them."
    natsumi "I heard you that first day you showed up in class, you know. You said you were into baseball in between all that mumbling. I had no idea you were that good though. That I figured out on my own."
    "Maybe if I keep staring straight ahead she'll stop talking."
    natsumi "It takes a lot of dedication, but I figured it out."
    natsumi "Why did you never say you went to Tohoku. Legendary Tohoku High. And an ace pitcher too. You're not just gonna let that go are you?"
    takeru "What? So you only got to know me so if you could figure out if I was any good?"
    natsumi "But from what I can see you are pretty good, aren't you? So it's not that bad, right?"
    "I won't dignify that with a response."
    "Did she seriously introduce herself and dog me around for a few weeks so she could get a handle on my baseball potential?"
    "Here I thought I actually had a friend in her."
    "Meiko finally finishes addressing the class and arrives in my defense."
    "As she sits down, it looks like she already has stock of the situation."
    meiko "Natsumi."
    natsumi "Hey Meiko. Can you help me convince Takeru he should fill in for Hiyama for games 1 and 5. We're so close to having a winning team, just a little shot to our pitching would - "
    meiko "Natsumi. Let Takeru speak."
    "What?"
    "Natsumi shuts up and makes some pleading face at me."
    "Is her enthusiasm supposed to be encouraging? I can't even tell if it's in earnest."
    takeru "I thought I was pretty clear the first time. Sorry, but I can't play b-baseball without..."
    takeru "Look..."
    "This would be so much easier if Meiko wasn't trying to mediating whatever this is supposed to be. How much of the truth does she know? How much do I have to reveal to get myself out of this mess?"
    "I'm seizing up. I have no response for this and I thought this was over."
    natsumi "Okay, okay, okay. Come to a practice some time, right?"
    meiko "Good luck with your tournament, Natsumi. We'll all be rooting for you."
    natsumi "Thanks Meiko. You're the best."
    "Meiko returns to her notes."
    "...But Natsumi isn't distracted. Instead she whispers."
    natsumi "If you're worried about Meiko, it's alright. I'm really just after a pitcher, not, y'know..."
    "I honestly don't know. She's not being reassuring and it's all I can do sit stock still and stare straight ahead. My face must be turning gray, but Natsumi is either oblivious or cruel."
    natsumi "We've got afternoon practice on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday this week. See you there!"
    "Not likely."
    "I mental note to avoid that entire side of school grounds for the forseeable future, and to avoid Natsumi for forever, hopefully."
    "This could've all been avoided if that other pitcher hadn't managed to injure himself. Hiyama, whereever you are, get well soon. Because it can't come fast enough."
    
    "At lunchtime, I leave as fast as possible. Whatever I have to make up in navigating the rush hour crowd, it's worth it in time not spent next to Natsumi."
    "By the time I get to the old wing, the crowd has dwindled to practically nobody. I'm pretty sure the supernatural club members make up half of all people I've ever seen down here."
    "I count the doors as I walk past. That one's a storage room. That one used to be a classroom but it's pretty much storage now. The piano room's in there."
    "I gulp when I pass the door to Hikari's tearoom."
    "I'll definitely meet her after school today. I don't dread seeing her like do Natsumi, it's more..."
    "There's something different in the way we relate to each other now, and it's not something I can put into words. It must be part of that reality-bending aura around her."
    "I climb the stairs to the old library. Again today, the door is closed. Mana must be out. I push open the door and take a step in."
    takeru "Hello?"
    "The light is off. The radio's off too."
    "I guess I must've fled class so fast I beat Hagami (and possibly Mana) up here."
    "As expected, varied books have already enroached on my usual eating space. I push them aside, then, on a whim, stack them up. I put the \"Brief Overview of Modern Musical Trends\" back on the shelf, where, with even the slightest bit of luck, I'll never have to see it again."
    "Still, no one arrives."
    "This place is eerie without the radio on. I can see why the supernatural club meets here."
    "I fiddle with the dials for a bit but can't get the radio to turn on, or even the CD to play. Then after jamming the eject button a few times, I realize the CD tray is empty."
    "I look around. There was that one top shelf in the corner with all the CDs, right? Finding it, I grab the last one off the row."
    "It's unlabeled. The disc is just blank, and the case transparent. Seeing as how all the other CDs have names of dead foreigners and titles like \"Opus 312.\" I'll take the unknown over any of those."
    "I insert the disc and jam the play button a times, but nothing. Maybe it's blank. This just isn't my day."
    "Is there really nobody else here today? Even after five minutes, there's no sign of Hagami, or Mana either."
    "I poke my head out the door. There's voices."
    "That's Natsumi for sure. I almost turn around when I hear Kenta. They both seem to be talking to..."
    kenta "This isn't hard. Why not just tell me when you can work on this? I don't understand why you're being so weird about this."
    hagami "..."
    natsumi "Hey you don't look too good. Want me to take you to the nurse?"
    hagami "I..."
    kenta "What exactly are you doing here again?"
    natsumi "Who me? I'm helping you out with your lab partner, dope."
    natsumi "You've gotta be more understanding, Kenta."
    "She turns to Hagami."
    natsumi "What'd you say your name was? Sorry about Kenta. He can be a little oblivious. But he's okay, I swear."
    hagami "..."
    natsumi "Oh I get it, you've got a cold or something and lost your voice. That's why so you look so ill. Hold still while I take your temperature."
    "I'm still trying to make any sense of this situation, but by the way Hagami flinces as Natsumi reaches out for her forehead, I should probably hurry and speak up."
    "...As much as I'd rather see zero more of Natsumi than I absolutely have to."
    takeru "Hey Kenta, Hagami. ...And hi, Natsumi."
    kenta "Good afternoon, Takeru."
    natsumi "Takeru! What brings you up here? And wait, you know her?"
    takeru "Yeah. What're you bugging her about?"
    kenta "She refuses to pick a time to meet and get this lab report over with. We could've been done with this Monday. So why go through all this trouble? Doesn't make sense."
    "He glares at Hagami, whose attention is permanently fixed at a spot on the floor."
    natsumi "You know how Kenta can misread situations, right Takeru? Looks like Hagami just has a cold. Come on, I'll take you down to the nurse's office. My name's Natsumi, by the way, I'm the - "
    takeru "I'll handle it, Natsumi. You can go eat lunch."
    natsumi "I don't mind."
    takeru "No, really."
    natsumi "Got it."
    "She winks at me. I don't appreciate it."
    natsumi "See you in class Takeru. And nice to meet you Hagami."
    "Alright, with her gone this gets easier."
    kenta "What's this about the nurse? How do you get sick about a lab report?"
    hagami "I'm..."
    kenta "Can you speak up? You're very quiet."
    takeru "Calm down a second, Kenta. Do you have your lunch on you?"
    kenta "Yes, but I usually eat downstairs. It's part of - "
    takeru "Come on."
    "I gesture at him to follow"
    "Hagami seems to have some idea of what's going on as she makes a pained smile at me, then heads straight for the old library. She holds the door and I follow after Kenta."
    "Kenta seems almost as out of sorts as Hagami now. He's staring at the wall-wall shelving with his mouth open."
    kenta "Was this the library? I thought this was a storage room before the fire."
    takeru "It's..."
    "I look to Hagami. She nods for me to continue."
    takeru "Yeah, the old library. Not that any of the books are useful. The supernatural club meets up here once in a while, but you can feel free to eat here for now while this gets worked out."
    "Kenta cautiosly takes a seat at the table in front of the space I cleared a few minutes ago. Hagami takes her place opposite him. I'm about to pull up a chair next to Kenta when Hagami gestures a clear spot on the table next to her."
    "Hagami opens her lunch, and Kenta, looking around, follows suit."
    "A solid 60 seconds pass. I guess I'm the only one uncomfortable with the silence. I wish I'd gotten that radio set up."
    "Finally I decide I might as well cut to it."
    takeru "Wait, Kenta, so Hagami is your mysterious lab partner."
    kenta "Who?"
    takeru "I swear, Kenta..."
    takeru "Kenta, this is Hagami. She's a supernatural club member and apparently in your class."
    "She stands and bows her head."
    takeru "And Hagami, this is Kenta. We're roommates."
    kenta "Good to meet you. Now can we please - "
    takeru "What exactly needs to get done, Kenta?"
    kenta "We're each supposed to be doing half. We need to work out a time to meet to get it done."
    kenta "It's a short assigment. This is two hours of work at most but I need to schedule it in somewhere. I can't plan if we don't do that."
    "Of course. I'm sure Kenta knows exactly what he'll be working on at all times. Except for this tiny paper... because he's working with Hagami."
    "Hagami leans in. I turn my ear."
    hagami "Just... divide and conquer."
    "She taps the table. I guess it's best to just do this now. She looks to Kenta."
    takeru "Kenta, do you have a copy of the assignment?"
    kenta "Yes, obviously."
    takeru "Here."
    "He hands over a single page handout. I search through my bag and find a pen mixed in with the festival forms and hand it to the open-handed Hagami."
    "She starts to mark up the page, but then pauses and looks to Kenta. I don't get it for a second, then she glances, then to Kenta."
    takeru "How about just dividing up the work? You each take half of it and you don't necessarily have to get everything done at the same time."
    kenta "I don't have a problem with that. Let's just get something done."
    takeru "Hagami will divy it up then."
    "It takes her less than a minute. I pass the page from her to Kenta."
    takeru "Does that look alright?"
    kenta "Fine."
    takeru "Then we should be set then?"
    "Hagami nods. Affirmative. Kenta keeps staring at her but she's fixed on some point 45 degrees to his left."
    takeru "Okay. Hope that clears things up, Kenta."
    kenta "It does, thanks."
    "Kenta tucks the page into his bag, then for some reason starts packing the remaining bits of his lunch back up as well."
    kenta "If you don't mind I'm going to finish my lunch downstairs."
    takeru "See you."
    kenta "It's just this a very weird place up here. I don't know how you keep your appetite Takeru."
    "And he's gone."
    "That's the second problem person out of the way. Crisis resolved?"
    "With a sigh of relief, Hagami finally starts in on her own lunch. For a few minutes, she just slowly eats. I notice she doesn't have that flushed, feverish look any more though."
    "Now though, she looks up."
    hagami "You're friends with some very strange people."
    takeru "Oh trust me, I know."
    "...Hagami and Mana included."
    takeru "Sorry about Natsumi and Kenta. They're nice enough, but... They can be really bad at reading people."
    hagami "How can be roommates with that... person?"
    takeru "Kenta? He's not so bad, I guess. Although sometimes I think he just assumes everyone's a clone of himself and thinks and acts the same way."
    takeru "He means well, though. You just have to get to know him."
    hagami "..."
    hagami "That's... not really something I enjoy."
    "She returns to her food, but, seeing me almost done, she slides a book towards me. I recognize the medical encyclopedia from yesterday."
    takeru "I'm even less likely to read this than that music textbook, you know. Don't think - "
    "But the book is already open, and Hagami taps on a specific page."
    takeru "'Social Anxiety Disorder?'"
    "I skim the page, then glance at Hagami. She has her arms folded on the table again, head resting on them."
    "She doesn't make eye contact but I ask my question anyway."
    takeru "Then that means..."
    takeru "You mean this is why you're at Mirako. You have this?"
    hagami "They think so, anyway. Something like it."
    takeru "...Right."
    "She still won't look at me."
    hagami "It wasn't always like this. It does make things more difficult."
    hagami "In my past life... I just couldn't keep up."
    takeru "Past life?"
    hagami "A hundred years ago I failed to attain enlightenment before my death and now, in the tradition of samsara, I've reincarnated as a lowly student."
    takeru "Wait, you think you an anxiety disorder because... some past you was... What?"
    hagami "It's a joke."
    hagami "I mean life before Mirako. You had one."
    takeru "Hang on, what do you know about that? Is someone spreading stories around, or - "
    hagami "I don't know anything about it."
    "She looks up."
    hagami "Most here were someone else before they came to Mirako. Me too."
    takeru "Oh."
    hagami "For some... it's just more painful than others. I don't pry."
    "...Unlike certain other people. Natsumi could learn a few lessons."
    hagami "There are more important things to know anyway."
    "Hagami sits up."
    hagami "Although I won't deny I'm curious."
    takeru "..."
    "She shrugs and goes back to reading. It's something old today. Possibly a textbook, because it has about a diagram a page, but then I realize all the diagrams involve pentagrams."
    "I'm done eating, but there's still some time to go before class. I bring out the festival contact forms, then put them away. I've done all I can now without actually talking to people, and I don't particularly want to do that at the moment."
    "The only nearby reading material are some books that look about as dubious as the one Hagami's browsing, and the medical manual, already open to the page on anxiety disorders."
    "I skim, but it's about what I expected. Self-consciousness. Worries about presentation. Avoidance of strangers and groups."
    "I close the book. If Hagami is doing me the favor of not poking around my background, I can at least do the same for her."
    "But still I wonder who exactly that \"past self\" Hagami was. Child prodigy? Actress? ...Baseball star?"
    "More likely Hagami was just... Hagami. A supernatural hobbying and enthusiast of deadpan jokes."
    "Oh well."
    "Mana would probably know, not that I'd ask. That'd be a violation of her privacy. Right?"
    "Then why did she open up to that page on anxiety disorders?"
    "It looks like Hagami herself has nothing more to say, though. She flips on the radio."
    "I guess the CD wasn't blank after all. There's a piano playing, but it sounds grainy, like a recording from twenty or thirty years ago. Some string instrument joins in."
    hagami "...Did you put that CD in?"
    takeru "What? Er, yeah. I was in here earlier before I came to look for you."
    hagami "Just wanted to make sure it wasn't Mana."
    "I don't really understand, but Hagami goes back to reading. I search my bag and find some homework to struggle with."
    "After a few minutes there's a silence and click from the radio, and the piano string duo moves to a new piece."
    "I notice Hagami isn't reading any more. Instead, she scratching at some with a pen. If we were in the same class this would probably be a good opportunity to get help with this physics work."
    "Although I guess if that's what I was looking for, I'd be eating with Meiko or someone."
    "In the last five minutes before class, I don't really make any progress. Looks like it's time to go. I stand up."
    takeru "See you tomorrow, Hagami. I'll tell Kenta you said hi."
    "She flips off the radio and walks with me to the door. As we close up the old library, she pulls out a folded piece of paper and present it to me."
    hagami "Again... Please don't let Mana know."
    takeru "What?"
    "It's the festival application. I unfold it and glance down the form. Everything's filled out."
    "But as I start to read, Hagami reaches out and folds the top of the page back down."
    hagami "You too."
    takeru "So I'm just supposed to hand this to Meiko and not look at it."
    hagami "I'll tell you later."
    "She walks off."
    "I'm left standing there in the hall, looking at the back of the paper where Hagami's pen bled through the page."
    "Should I read it anyway? I'm pretty sure this is another over-engineered joke from the mind of Hagami."
    "I stow her application in my bag with the others. Oh well. Guess it would be in poor sport to spoil the punchline."
    
    "Back to class."
    "Looks like I was a little earlier than I thought. No sign of the teacher but Natsumi is immediately ready to greet me. She's inescapable."
    natsumi "Hey, look who's here."
    natsumi "So, Takeru... Who was that? Was she alright?"
    takeru "Hi Natsumi. You mean Hagami?"
    natsumi "Is that her name? I guess she must've been pretty sick if she didn't want to talk to me, even. You got her to the nurse alright?"
    "I roll my eyes and don't bother arguing."
    takeru "She'll be fine."
    natsumi "Funny girl. I don't think I've actually seen around until today."
    natsumi "How do you know her anyway?"
    takeru "Er... She's a member of the supernatural club. I'm not quite a member and it's not really a real club, but..."
    "I hesistate. It's kind of hard to explain."
    natsumi "Aha! This explains a lot."
    takeru "What now?"
    natsumi "You're spending all your time after school hanging out at this little club. You've got no time for baseball. You won't join up because you're too busy chasing after this..."
    "She squints her eyes and squeezes her chin."
    natsumi "...chasing after this Hagami character."
    takeru "I..."
    "Not this again. Natsumi really does have a one track mind."
    "But I really don't want to explain the supernatural club to her. Maybe if I let her believe her left field explanation she'll leave me alone."
    takeru "Fine."
    natsumi "Y'know I could give you some time off from practice if that's what it'd take. Just don't catch that cold from her, Romeo."
    takeru "Look, Natsumi, I hardly know you, I don't have to... I'm not joining your team. So if you can please just..."
    "Meiko arrives to save me."
    meiko "Hello Natsumi, and hi Takeru. What's going on?"
    natsumi "Apparently Kenta's no-show lab partner is Takeru's..."
    "She winks at me as I grimace."
    natsumi "...friends."
    natsumi "Looks like she was sick a few days so Kenta couldn't get in touch."
    natsumi "I ran into them so I tried to help."
    meiko "Please, Natsumi, you shouldn't tease Kenta."
    natsumi "I don't tease him. I was trying to work things out!"
    "...and succeeding only in making things work. Nice, Natsumi."
    meiko "I don't think Kenta recognizes you. He's sweet but you've got get to know him first. We were friends last year so I try to help him when I can."
    natsumi "Aaah Meiko, you can't be everyone's guardian angel day in day out. Don't feel like you have to be everywhere at once."
    meiko "I've been managing it fine so far. When you need help studying or managing a guy on the team, who do you come to?"
    natsumi "The one and only amazing Meiko."
    meiko "Takeru, I've been trying my hardest to get you situated, right?"
    takeru "Er..."
    "While it's been great to have a familiar face these first few weeks, I feel like I'd be more comfortable at Mirako without that tangle of guilt, nostalgia, and vague memory that's Meiko's signature."
    takeru "That's right. Thanks for helping me out."
    meiko "So I think I'm more than able to deal with Kenta's problems."
    natsumi "Whatever."
    "Natsumi's words are combative, but now she starts to look concerned."
    natsumi "But help yourself out first. You worry about too many people. We can work out stuff on our own once in a while."
    meiko "If that's the way you want it."
    "Meiko turns up her chin at Natsumi. I think Meiko shrugged it off, but when she turns towards me, there are lines around her forehead."
    "Finally she turns a shoulder to Natsumi and talks to me directly."
    meiko "Takeru, do you have those forms all sorted out?"
    takeru "Er, not quite. I have a few, but didn't you say you didn't need them in until tomorrow?"
    meiko "Well, that's when the council will review them. But I want to look things over first, just to make sure you didn't miss any details. I wouldn't want to resubmit forms to the council when they're still flawed."
    "She frowns."
    takeru "Sorry about that. I guess I misunderstood. I'll wrap this up as soon as I can tomorrow."
    meiko "Thanks for you help anyway. Maybe I'll look over what you have so far, if you have them on you."
    "I shuffle through my things to the pile of papers, pull out the three or four papers for the people I tracked down this morning, and hand the bundle to Meiko. She tries to hide her disappointment at the size of the stack."
    takeru "It's not much."
    meiko "Well, better than nothing."
    takeru "Let me know if there's anything else I can do then."
    meiko "You've been a big help already, so I'd almost feel bad asking, but..."
    takeru "It's fine. I think I've just been slowing you down."
    meiko "Not at all. Are you free Sunday? The day after tomorrow."
    takeru "I... didn't really have anything planned, no."
    meiko "I need to move a grill up to Mirako from a rental place in town, and there's not really a truck available. It's a two person job."
    takeru "I'll help out if you need."
    "Moving heavy objects. This is fine. I've managed to screw up pretty much all of the intellectual tasks Meiko has handed out so at least I shouldn't be able to bungle this one."
    meiko "You're always appreciated, Takeru. I'll meet you outside the dorms then?"
    takeru "Got it."
    "Finally our teacher arrives, and Meiko turns back to face the front of the room."
    "I settle in for another lecture. Sunday seems far away now. But I guess it's easier for me to look forward to a day of being useful than a day off."
    
    "After classes end, I make an effort to track down more of the students on my incomplete festival application hitlist."
    "As dumb as I feel repeatedly intoducing myself to these people over and over, it's not quite as dumb as I feel screwing up Meiko's odd jobs."
    "I'm almost sure at this point that she's just tasking me with these errands to give me a way to atone."
    "When I took off for Tohoku those four or five years ago, I basically left her high and dry."
    "Sure, I felt guilty back then for not saying anything, at least, but I thought I'd never see her again. I had a clean conscience in no time."
    "Why is it so difficult this go around? Meiko already forgave me. So why do I keep dwelling on it?"
    "Luckily most of the students on the list are members of clubs so they've still been at Mirako after the end of class. I'll have to catch up to the stragglers tomorrow."
    "With that done, I realize I'm in the old wing again."
    "It would be great to talk to someone right now, but, Hikari?"
    "I'm not quite sure where we stand, but it's not like there's any other way to find out."
    takeru "Hikari?"
    "Inside the tearoom, I pull the shades and close the door. No sign of her. I open the door again and pop my head out to the hall, but, no one there either. When I turn back, she's sitting at the table."
    hikari "You're a bit late, aren't you?"
    takeru "Oh, there you are, I almost thought you'd vanished for a second. And I didn't know there was some fixed time we meet up."
    "Hikari shrugs with a stiff, slight motion."
    hikari "You seem to come here after school pretty often."
    takeru "I guess."
    takeru "You... You can leave this room, right?"
    hikari "Yes. You've seen me around. I just normally don't have any reason or need to."
    hikari "How does tea sound?"
    takeru "Sounds excellent."
    "Of course, I'm the one preparing the tea. And the only one drinking the tea. As usual, Hikari relishes the teacup in front of her, breathing in the aroma... But she never takes a sip."
    "She probably can't."
    takeru "Hey, Hikari..."
    hikari "Thanks for the tea."
    takeru "This might sound dumb, but, er, yesterday... We did have a conversation about how you were, well... Not, well..."
    hikari "You can day 'dead,' by the way. I don't mind."
    takeru "You don't mind being dead?"
    hikari "That's not quite what I said. I definitely do mind. Although..."
    "Hikari closes her eyes for a few moments."
    hikari "I don't mind all that much. There's more time to do things properly."
    hikari "All I miss is people. That everyone could forget so quickly, it's..."
    hikari "I try not to hold it against anyone, but seeing life just go on without you is a disheartening."
    takeru "I sort of understand."
    hikari "I doubt it."
    "Hikari's teeth are ever so slightly bared as she glowers at her teacup. I only have a chance to register her expression before her face softens."
    hikari "How is everyone, then? What's the mood at Mirako?"
    takeru "The mood? Kind of hard to say. I'm still just a transfer student so I don't know what ordinary life really looks like. I guess the festival's coming up again, right?"
    takeru "Oh, and a baseball tournament too. I don't know how many people care about, that captain keeps pestering me to join up. I think you met her. Natsumi."
    "I do my best to explain the situation. It's the first time I've ever actually laid this out for someone I think."
    "Meiko would probably seem like someone I could trust with this, but she feels too involved. They always seemed like friends, so I don't know what happened this afternoon"
    "And I don't know how Natsumi found that Tohoku stats book, either."
    hikari "I guess you only have to deal with this for another week or two until the tournament. I'm sure that's small comfort though."
    takeru "Yeah. I should probably stop complaining."
    hikari "Well... Don't let anyone push you around."
    "She seems more distracted then normal focused self."
    hikari "You probably don't know, but... Who's organizing the festvial this year? The student council?"
    takeru "Yep. Or at least Meiko is. It's complicated but I knew her going. It seems like she's got evertything under control."
    "There's a faraway look on Hikari's face. She seems even less cheery than usual."
    hikari "...She's doing alright for herself then?"
    takeru "Meiko? You know her then?"
    hikari "Like you said, it's complicated. Everything Meiko is complicated."
    "She talks to no one in particular."
    hikari "What's she been up to this past year then?"
    takeru "Planning the festival, but apart from that... I only know her from years ago. We pretty much grew up together. We used to be good friends."
    hikari "Then that's what I want to hear about. Do you mind telling me about it? If it's not too unpleasant."
    takeru "Not at all."
    "It is a bit of an uncomfortable story for me though, in that anyone who hears it will probably come to the conclusion that I'm a heartless bastard."
    "We knew each other at first. Then she lost her parents and moved in with her aunt's family, just down the road."
    "I spent time with her, but I spent time with the guys I played baseball with too. And then when the scout from Tohoku showed up, I bit at the opportunity."
    "I could've said goodbye, but... it wouldn't have changed the fact that I was always going to leave."
    "Hikari just brews over her tea while I explain this. Don't ask me why I'm fine with telling her all this. She's always seemed to be disconnected and impartial that it just feels right. Maybe not right, but at least comfortable."
    "It takes Hikari a few moments to reply. She stands up, shakily, and walks over the cabinets. She's looking right at the carved chess set."
    hikari "I think I understand her a little better now."
    takeru "Meiko?"
    hikari "Meiko."
    hikari "When I knew her, I always had questions, but, knowing where she came from."
    hikari "I said it was complicated."
    "I keep waiting for her to elaborate, but it never comes. Instead..."
    hikari "What... What was your name?"
    takeru "Er, are you... I'm Takeru. Hikari, are you alright?"
    hikari "I don't recall..."
    "I'm trying to figure out what I can even do to help her. I look from the door, to the shelves, the windows, the counter... There's got to be something around here. I don't even know what's going on."
    takeru "Hikari, what - "
    "But when I turn back to her, she's gone."
    hikari "You said something?"
    takeru "Ah!"
    "She's sitting at the table. In just the spot she was when I entered."
    takeru "When did you - "
    hikari "Oh. You're still here, Takeru."
    takeru "What just happened?"
    hikari "I don't think anything happened."
    takeru "You... asked me my name?"
    hikari "I don't remember that."
    "She just looks confused."
    hikari "Do you need to sit down?"
    takeru "I think so."
    takeru "It must just be my mind playing tricks on me. I could've sworn you said something and then..."
    hikari "Maybe not."
    hikari "Do you ever have those dreams, like where everything is plausible and familiar, and then, you spot a detail? Just a speck out of place, and you realize, 'this must be a dream?'"
    takeru "Not for a long time, but, I think I know what you're talking about."
    hikari "And then everything in the dream world falls apart. Then you wake up."
    hikari "I felt like I was nodding off and just woke up."
    "There's nothing I can do but nod. I don't get it at all. It was probably another slipup in my dysfunctinoal brain."
    hikari "Thanks for the tea."
    "It's untouched, of course, but I can tell I'm being dismissed."
    takeru "Right. I guess I'd better head home. Thanks for listening to me go on about my dumb problems for a bit."
    hikari "It was the most, well, real thing I've heard in a while. See you later."
    takeru "Bye."
    "I leave the door half-closed behind me and take a few trepidatious steps down the hall."
    "Knowing Hikari's secret, I had thought these little slipups in memory would be slowing down. But there's still something not quite right, for at least one of us."
    "Maybe I still don't know the full truth."
    

label day09a:
    
    "It's another bleary-eyed morning."
    "I feel like I've woken up five minutes before my alarm but I can't focus on the clock on my dresser."
    "Oh. Of course. It's being obscured by three embalmed frogs, a very foreign horned toad, and three other miscellaneous amphibians. Plus assorted empty jars."
    "Is it even worth the effort to go over there?"
    "I start to rise, then..."
    "WHAM."
    takeru "Kenta, what on earth are you..."
    "I don't bother waiting for his explanation (or his second punch) and instead jump out of bed, sheets still flailing behind."
    kenta "Good morning Takeru."
    takeru "Why - "
    kenta "This isn't good. Can you never set your alarm right? I don't mind waking you up, but you always act so strange. You'll find saying your 'thank you' every once in a while goes a long way."
    takeru "Look - "
    "My own alarm clock cuts me off. I push aside a few jars and slam it off."
    takeru "Never mind."
    "With a sigh, I prepare to survive another day. It's becoming increasingly hard to do anything in our room, which under Kenta's supervision has transformed into a terrarium for all things stinky in green."
    "The horned toad, in particular, eyes me from suspended animation as I grab by bag and shut the door."
    takeru "I'm serious about getting a trophy case or a cabinet or something, this is beyond..."
    takeru "Okay. All set."
    kenta "Good. Let's hurry."
    "Despite Kenta's fears, there's no one on the road. We're practically the first through the gates."
    "One of these days I need to stop humoring Kenta and quit being so on time all the time, but for now... This is convenient. I still need to track down the rest of the festival applicants. Anyone on the hitlist that I can't find now I'll have to hunt down during lunch."
    "Fortunately most of them seem to be around. Unfortunately I'm terrible for the job. Nobody has any idea who I am and trying to explain exactly why I'm the one handing back their rejected application is a little tricky."
    "Meiko's name seems to go a long way though. It's true everyone's heard of her. And most just shut up and fix their paperwork problems. Guess she really is the embodiment of \"everything running smoothly.\""
    "With only one no-show on the list, I head to class."
    
    "Natsumi's already there when I get to homeroom."
    takeru "Hey, Natsumi. Good morning."
    natsumi "Hey Takeru."
    "She raises a hand in greeting but doesn't say anything further. Is this a sign she's given up on the whole baseball thing?"
    "Doesn't look that way. When Meiko takes her seat, Natsumi greets her with a mumble and goes back to penciling some spreadsheets out across her desk. She's probably just feeling antisocial."
    "Meiko doesn't acknowledge Natsumi at all. Don't tell me they're still upset about that trivial argument yesterday?"
    meiko "Hello, Takeru. Having a good morning?"
    takeru "Decent, I guess. Actually, kind of unpleasant."
    takeru "Did Kenta have any weird hobbies when you knew him last year?"
    meiko "Weird hobbies? Oh not really... Although I do think had some project to contribute all the Mirako area train schedules to some sort of national database. I don't remember if anything came of it."
    takeru "Too bad he had to switch to collecting junk..."
    meiko "Do you have those forms all in order?"
    takeru "One to go."
    meiko "Good work."
    meiko "...Oh, before I forget, I reviewed the forms you got me yesterday."
    takeru "That's fast."
    meiko "We've got make sure everything's perfect. Anyway, they all looked good. There is only one exception."
    meiko "Someone tried to file under a fake club."
    takeru "Fake? Like someone's trying to get a budget for the competitive Rubik's society or something?"
    meiko "Just not officially registered."
    "She holds up the form. I know it before she turns it around. Meiko's red marks dot every field on the page. It's Hagami's."
    takeru "That... You mean the supernatural club."
    meiko "Oh, so you do remember. That club isn't on the records anywhere, so, it isn't actually a club, really."
    meiko "They even went so far as to book a room after school each day for every singly day this year. Pretty elaborate."
    takeru "I'm sure there's just paperwork missing. Right?"
    "Although I'm starting to wonder. The supernatural club has always been just something Mana called the two of them when Hagami and Mana ate together in the old library. They could've just booked space to hang out without really thinking through the registration process."
    meiko "I guess. Until then I can't really handle the festival budget request though, can I?"
    meiko "And I should probably cancel that room reservation while I'm at it..."
    takeru "..."
    takeru "I know who filed that. I'll work it out."
    meiko "Really? Thank you Takeru."
    "I'm still pretty sure Hagami's blank application is some sort of inscrutable prank, but, all the same, I'd rather not have the two of them get kicked out of their library."
    "After lunch I'll have to talk to them I guess."
    "In the meantime, before the teacher arrives, I'm treated to this new standoff between Meiko and Natsumi."
    "I could tell she was eavesdropping before, but now Natsumi is fidgeting around and looking at anything but Meiko. Meiko, for her part, sits straight and serene, as usual."
    "Hopefully this new elevated defcon level won't last. It's almost more uncomfortable than ever."
    
    "At lunch, I flee the cold war and head to the old library."
    "There's chatter within as I push open the door. Guess it's back to all three of us today."
    takeru "Hi Hagami. And hey Mana. Welcome back."
    mana "Ah! It's Takeru! I missed everyone while I was out. It's good to be at Mirako again."
    takeru "Where've you been the past couple days?"
    mana "Oh. Just sick. I'm doing my best, but..."
    "She coughs into the crook of her arm. Come to think of it, she does seem a little pale."
    takeru "Don't push yourself."
    mana "Oh don't worry about me. I'm fine, I swear!"
    takeru "Right..."
    "Hagami pats Mana on the back while she continues to sniffle. I look to her for some sort of confirmation, but Hagami just offers me a grimace. Guess Mana isn't as healthy as she says."
    mana "Sorry, sorry..."
    "I clear my usual place at the table and take out my lunch and my physics textbook. I have some studying to do and I swear this class is just as foreign to me as the metaphysical garbage that Hagami reads, so I'll fit right in."
    "Mana and Hagami continue to talk."
    mana "Did everything go alright with your lab partner?"
    hagami "...We're done."
    mana "Good! Or... Do you mean you're done working with him? Nothing went wrong I hope?"
    takeru "Is this Kenta you're talking about. Do I have to get him in order again?"
    hagami "No, it's, we're all set. All done."
    mana "Great job. Sorry I wasn't around to help out!"
    "Hagami shrugs."
    hagami "It's my fault. I'll do better next time."
    mana "Huh?"
    hagami "I'm... holding myself back."
    mana "Well, I mean, it's good you're trying, right?"
    takeru "If you're looking for easy-to-work-with people, Kenta wouldn't be my top choice. Or Natsumi. I swear she can..."
    mana "Everyone at Mirako's very accepting. So don't feel guilty!"
    hagami "I'm just sick of this."
    "She doesn't say it to anyone in particular. It's like she's talking to the book propped up in front of her."
    "Mana looks like she has something to say, but interrupts herself with a sneeze, then remains quiet. I notice she hasn't touched her food."
    "There's probably nothing Hagami wants to hear from me, so I shut up. The silence isn't very comforting though. I fiddle with the radio in vain. Maybe this piece of junk only responds to Hagami."
    "Seeing me lose my fight with a radio knob, Hagami shoots out a hand, hits three buttons, and the thing turns on. I look at her but she hasn't taken her eyes off her reading."
    "It's that same decades-old recording from yesterday. I catch maybe five seconds of piano before the sound vanishes. It's Hagami's doing again, but this time she's at attention. She looks at Mana, but Mana is still happily involved in a paperback."
    mana "Gonna leave the radio off today?"
    hagami "...It's more peaceful."
    "I notice she ejects the disc before going back to her book, brow furrowed. The title's printed twice, first in Russian, then \"Berezhnoy's Account of the Spirits of the Silver Bridge.\" I'm pretty sure it's the CD that has her unnerved though, right."
    "Oh well. There's something else I need to bring up before I forget."
    takeru "So... This is the supernatural club right?"
    mana "Don't worry, it was Hagami that shut the radio off, not a poltergeist. Although there is a poltergeist around here somewhere! Once, I - "
    "Mana's cough gives me an opportunity to butt in."
    takeru "I mean, is the supernatural club, like... a real club?"
    mana "Of course! We meet almost every day. We hang out together? What's more real than that?"
    takeru "Er, registration with Mirako, I'd think."
    mana "Oh. That isn't too too tough, right? We'd just need four members and a mission statement or something like that. And I've got that perfect mission statement planned out. 'By day or by night, by ghosthunt or by - "
    takeru "What's this about four members though?"
    mana "We already have three. But it's not like we were planning on registering, anyway. What's the point?"
    takeru "For one, I'm not a member. For another, the festival..."
    mana "Huh?"
    "Hagami looks up from the Russian bridge spirits again. Right. I wasn't supposed to bring this up."
    "Wait, then how am I supposed to let Hagami know her budget application failed? And that there's an outside chance they might get run out of their library?"
    "There might not be anything for it but to find Hagami alone later."
    takeru "Never mind."
    mana "We haven't had problems so far! So why - "
    "Mana sneezes so hard she's propelled backwards out of her chair. She lands unceremoniously on her butt."
    takeru "Are you alright?"
    mana "I'm doing much better than yesterday! So I should be fine. I just need to - "
    "She rises and staggers, then loses her balance and falls towards the table."
    "Hagami and I both jump up. I catch Mana. Hagami shields the radio."
    hagami "...Don't be judgmental. It's very delicate."
    takeru "Whatever."
    takeru "Mana, you're really not looking so great. Do you need someone to take you down to the nurse's office?"
    mana "...Maybe."
    "Hagami starts to pack her things but I wave at her to stop."
    takeru "I've got it. I need to track down some senior about his terrible handwriting on this application form before heading back to class anyway."
    hagami "Alright."
    mana "Sorry, Takeru... Maybe I shouldn't have come in today after all."
    "I follow Mana out the door to the hall, quickly, because it looks like she'll topple over at any minute."
    "We start downstairs to the sound of Mana's sniffling. Eventually she turns to look at me."
    mana "I hate being sick. It's such a pain."
    takeru "At least it's temporary."
    mana "I guess, but in the meantime it sucks. I hate not being their for Hagami, too."
    mana "Oh, I meant to say..."
    mana "I don't know what you did for Hagami yesterday while I was out, but..."
    mana "She's grateful you're around, you know."
    takeru "You mean with Kenta? Driving off Natsumi?"
    mana "I guess! It's hard to think we didn't know you at all a month ago."
    mana "Hagami's funny. It's hard to earn her trust. I always admired her in middle school, and she's the one that got me into the occult, and since then, when she's got something hard to say, it's usually been through me..."
    mana "Maybe it's because of your initiation as an Acolyte of the Mirako Numinous Spirit-Hunters and - "
    takeru "Slow down, slow down."
    "She almost trips over herself again."
    takeru "Besides, it wasn't that big a deal. I just kept my odd duck of a roommate in check."
    mana "Maybe, but... We've all got to watch each others' backs, right?"
    mana "It must be tough being her."
    takeru "Hagami?"
    mana "Yeah. She must feel like it's a prison here. She's so talented."
    takeru "What do you mean?"
    mana "Whoops! She'll tell you when it's time. Or at least I'll tell you when she wants me to. That's Hagami for you."
    takeru "I'm not sure I understand, but, alright."
    mana "Hm, hm..."
    "Mana thinks for a second, sniffling."
    mana "There are people it's tough to talk to right? People you admire, or, you know, they're just better at the things that are important to you, like... For me it'd be storytelling. Or the supernatural."
    mana "People that are just intimidating."
    takeru "I guess?"
    "I'm thinking of the older guys on the Tohoku team. Guys who'd gotten offers from the major leagues already. You respected your elders on our team, or you paid the price."
    "Or is she talking about people like... Meiko? Someone so well put together you just feel inferior talking to them."
    mana "It's easier to talk through someone else, right?"
    mana "Everyone's a bit like that in Hagami's world."
    mana "Everyone but me. But... now maybe you too."
    "Should I be flattered?"
    "We come to the entrance of the nurses office."
    mana "Sorry to get weird on you. I'm a bit woozy."
    takeru "No problem."
    mana "See you tomorrow! I hope."
    
    "I track down the last person on Meiko's faulty form list."
    "It takes a bit of time, and I have to go through three or four seniors before someone finally knows where this guy is."
    "Turns out the \"6\" on his form was indeed supposed to be a \"5.\" There. With the last of them done, I think I can finally say I've completed a task to Meiko's satisfaction."
    "With five minutes before the end of lunch bell, I head back to the classroom. There's hardly anyone back yet, but before I've even finished sitting down..."
    takeru "My physics book. Dammit."
    "It's upstairs in the old library."
    "I take off down the hall, through the old wing, up the stairs to that discolored brown door."
    "I catch my breath then listen for a second. Hagami's probably left already, but there's another faint sound coming from inside."
    "Well I can't stand around forever unless I want to be late. I push open the door and step in."
    takeru "Hagami?"
    hagami "...!"
    "It's clear I startled her. There's a thud as she drops that Russian hardcover back to the table."
    "She stares at me for a few seconds. I recognize the sound now. It's just the radio again."
    takeru "Sorry if I scared you. I just forgot a textbook. Let me just grab that."
    hagami "I noticed. Here."
    takeru "Thanks."
    "She still seems out of sorts though. She refuses eye contact as she hands over the book."
    takeru "Oh, hey, I'm short on time, but..."
    takeru "You know that whole thing about officially registering the club?"
    hagami "...Yes. Mana and I tried last year. No one's interested in the occult so we didn't bother."
    takeru "There's a bit more than that. I talked to Meiko, she's the one in charge of student events at the festival, and er, she can't accept yours if it's not from an official club."
    takeru "Or... Is that why you submitted it?"
    hagami "No."
    takeru "Sorry. I have trouble telling if you're joking sometimes."
    takeru "But it doesn't look like the supernatural club will be able to do whatever you have planned. Meiko's not overly happy about your hanging out in here either."
    hagami "..."
    takeru "What exactly were you going to do, anyway?"
    "She moves her mouth but no words come out."
    hagami "Nothing. Please don't tell Mana."
    hagami "It was never really all that important."
    "But her expression says otherwise."
    takeru "Right..."
    takeru "Er, sorry to run in, drop bad news, and run, but... Class is starting really soon. Are you coming?"
    hagami "In a bit. Bye."
    "I pause at the door."
    "Hagami has her back turned to me, facing away from the table with its piled books and radio."
    "That's right. The music today is the same as yesterday. Old recording, some string instrument with piano."
    "I thought she shut that off?"
    "Somehow I get the impression that Hagami's festival application was deadly serious. Unfortunately I really don't have time to stand around and think about it."
    "I jog back the class, hopefully before the bell."
    
    "It's a good thing I remembered my book. Next up is our sciences class, and physics is up."
    "I absolutely hate this subject. Academics at Tohoku weren't exactly rigorous, especially not for me, and this is one of those areas where it shows."
    teacher "And so, if we have the following amperage values in this circuit, it's possible to solve for voltage by substituting..."
    "Natsumi leans in next to me."
    natsumi "Do you have any idea what's going on?"
    takeru "Not in the slightest."
    natsumi "I really need to try harder in this class if I can't do any better than Takeru..."
    takeru "I heard that, you know."
    "On second thought, maybe I should've ditched the book and skipped class to take a nap somewhere. It would've been more productive than listening to this."
    "I'm woken out of my stupor by a knock on the door. The teacher pauses explaining the diagram chalked up on the board to look to the source of the noise."
    "It's a student, a senior. She enters and whispers to the teacher before exiting as quickly as she came."
    teacher "Let's see here... Meiko?"
    meiko "Yes sir?"
    teacher "You're needed down at the admin's office for something about the festival."
    teacher "You probably know this material already... But hurry back, okay?"
    meiko "Will do."
    "She pauses at the door and brushes her hair back."
    meiko "Sorry for the interruption."
    "With Meiko gone, the lecture resumes."
    "Natsumi leans in again to our inept students' conspiracy."
    natsumi "See? Always busy. What did I tell her?"
    takeru "If I had to manage that much into my schedule I'd cry."
    nastumi "But I'm sure there's room for something, right?"
    takeru "What?"
    "She waggles her eyebrows."
    natsumi "Base. Ball."
    "I give her the most intimidating face I can manage (which isn't much) and turn away."
    "But... With Meiko gone, I spot a girl across the room. An unfamiliar face."
    "Or, rather, a familiar face. Just... Never someone I expected."
    takeru "What the..."
    "I stare."
    hikari "..."
    "She returns my gaze for a moment, then mouths for me to be quiet. She doesn't seem especially thrilled with me."
    "Hikari?"
    "What on earth is she doing here? Did she just decide to coopt an empty desk and play at being a student for a class or two?"
    "I'm too dumbstruck to notice the teacher asking a question."
    teacher "Then, can anyone explain to me how to find the resistance of this circuit? Keep in mind the equations we know about resistor sequences..."
    "Natsumi shrinks beside me. I do my best to look small as well, but I keep glancing back and forth at Hikari. Maybe I'm hallucinating."
    "But no. She raises her hand."
    teacher "Yes? Ehm..."
    teacher "I'm sorry, I'm drawing a blank."
    hikari "It's Hikari."
    teacher "How rude of me. Hikari, care to explain on the board?"
    "Hikari walks to the front of the room and takes the piece of chalk from the teacher."
    "I glance at Natsumi, but she doesn't seem to notice Hikari. She's just basking in the relief that she wasn't called."
    hikari "...so, substitute..."
    hikari "Hm. No, it doesn't work out."
    teacher "Perhaps try - "
    hikari "Fine. What do I need to know about resistors anyway?"
    hikari "I haven't been taught the formular for this. In any case it's all irrelevant."
    "Even if it wasn't Hikari up in front of the class, I would be paying attention now. She hands the chalk back to the teacher and almost stomps back to the desk."
    teacher "Ehm. Miss."
    hikari "It's Hikari."
    teacher "Maybe you'd better study some more. This... is imporant material."
    "She crosses her arms."
    "I'm still aghast."
    "First, Hikari shows up in class. And now this blatantly disrespectful response to the teacher?"
    "Hikari catches me staring and uncrosses her arms. She's still scowling though."
    "Beside me, Natsumi is slouched down again, her panic at almost being called apparently forgotten. Did she just totally miss that?"
    "When I look over at Hikari again, she's clearly annoyed with me. Her eyebrows are raised and she gestures to the front of the room."
    "Is she trying to tell me to pay attention to class? When she just got up there and scribbled all over the diagram?"
    "I'm even more distracted than ever but manage to make it to the end of class."
    "In the transition period between the bells, I try in vain to find Hikari. Either she vanished or she's better at avoiding people than she looks. I suppose being what amounts to a ghost would make it significantly easier."
    "Somewhere in the hubbub, Meiko returns. As I take my seat for the next class, I realize Meiko blocks my view to Hikari's desk. Is she there or not?"
    "I lean back to try and see past her."
    natsumi "What the heck are doing swaying back and forth like that?"
    takeru "Trying to... Never mind."
    natsumi "Weirdo. Are you making eyes at Meiko or something?"
    takeru "Oh shut up."
    "I can't even tell if Hikari's there any more."
    "I might as well give up and try to focus on class. It's a mostly wasted effort but at least it's a distraction."
    "After what seems an age of trying to not to look at the right half of the room, the day's classes finally come to an end."
    "In some divine act of minor relief, Natsumi is out of the room almost before I can stand up. As I start to look around for Hikari, however, someone else walks up to me."
    meiko "Hello, Takeru."
    takeru "What? Oh. Hey Meiko. Have you seen..."
    "Then I realize there's absolutely no way I can ask her this."
    meiko "Hm?"
    takeru "Never mind."
    takeru "Oh. I've got the forms ready for you. Everything should be filled out now."
    meiko "Thanks Takeru. I might not have the chance to review them, but..."
    meiko "It's good to know I can count on you to get this done before the deadline."
    takeru "Er, right. Sorry."
    "Don't ask me why I feel guilty for doing her a favor."
    meiko "Are you still free for tomorrow?"
    takeru "I remembered, yeah. You need someone to help move equipment from downtown or something?"
    meiko "That's right, we're renting a grill. Can I meet you around lunchtime tomorrow? If you're busy, I'm sure I can find someone to sub in..."
    takeru "No, it's fine. I'm not doing anything anyway, and I promised to help out, right?"
    "Her smile seems too sweet for me."
    meiko "Thank you for help. I'd love to stick around and chat, but, there's another council meeting. I'll have to thank you properly tomorrow."
    takeru "See you later then."
    "It feels nice to finally get those festival forms out of my bag, but, at the moment I'm mostly just looking to catch a glimpse of Hikari among the students heading home, to clubs, or just milling around."
    "Finally I spot her outside. I catch up to Hikari in the hall."
    takeru "Hikari."
    hikari "Well, hello. I thought you'd never notice."
    takeru "Notice? Notice what? Your coming to class for some reason?"
    hikari "I've been in there all day and then suddenly your jaw drops during physics."
    takeru "Er, sorry, I don't really expect random people to show up in my classroom, it sort of..."
    hikari "If... If things were different, maybe I'd be your classmate this year."
    takeru "Right."
    hikari "Are you going to join me in the tearoom?"
    takeru "Sure. I'm free."
    "We head down the hall, fighting against the tide of students."
    "By the time we reach the old wing, the flow has dwindled to nobody at all. I slide open the door for Hikari."
    hikari "This does feel more like home than a classroom."
    takeru "What exactly were you doing?"
    hikari "Exactly what it looked like."
    takeru "Disrupting class for the hell of it?"
    hikari "No. Do you ever pay attention?"
    "She sits down in front of the table. I take my place as well, unsure what she's getting at. Hopefully I didn't offend her too badly."
    hikari "Did you notice how people treated me?"
    takeru "No, I'm sorry. I didn't even see you were there until you answered that question. It looks like the physics teacher just thought he forgot your name."
    hikari "Everyone was like that."
    hikari "They all thought it was a trick of their memory. Forgetfulness."
    hikari "Takeru, how is it that everyone in this school is so unwilling to believe?"
    takeru "Believe what?"
    hikari "Believe what's right before their eyes. I snuck into your class and sat there half the day."
    hikari "And instead of calling me out... Everyone just assumed it was a trick of their memory."
    takeru "Er... Memory's a tricky thing. You've thrown me for a loop plenty of times."
    hikari "Is it really something about me?"
    takeru "I always assumed it was something about me."
    "She's silent. I've never seen her so frustrated."
    hikari "Takeru, half of those people in that room I knew."
    takeru "You knew them last year?"
    hikari "Some of them."
    hikari "They'd all choose to believe that they forgot some girl's name than that their old classmate suddenly appeared in front of them."
    hikari "I answered that stupid circuits question on purpose. I had no idea what the teacher was talking about. I've only taken first year classes here."
    hikari "You looked very confused. Baffled, almost."
    "Hikari laughs to herself a moment."
    hikari "But nobody else cared."
    takeru "I don't know... I thought it was..."
    hikari "What?"
    takeru "You're trying to talk with people, right?"
    hikari "I don't know. I'm pusing boundaries. I want to know exactly where I stand."
    takeru "I think that's a good thing."
    hikari "Why?"
    takeru "...I said a few days ago you always seemed like you were trapped in this room."
    takeru "It's nice to see you outside of it some time."
    takeru "So even if it's frustrating... I'm glad you care about other people. It's like your less..."
    hikari "Less what?"
    takeru "If I had to put a word to it..."
    takeru "Less lost."
    "She chuckles, but she's smiling."
    "Whenever I've seen Hikari outside of this room, she's always been wandering. She's never showed up outside without a purpose. She's always just been pacing around."
    hikari "I'm glad you think that, but, I've felt lost for almost a year now."
    hikari "It's really only in the past few weeks I've seen there's anything else to it."
    hikari "It's irrelevant. Today was still a disaster, but, maybe if you think so, not as bad as I thought it was."
    "Reflecting on this, Hikari seems to drift off a moment. I'm still trying to understand what she's talking about."
    "I hope she'll come out from her room more, though. Strange as it was, I thought in the moment she was more an odd classmate of mine than some silent spirit, trapped in Mirako's desolate basement somewhere."
    "What was she like when she was alive? So much of what I know about Hikari is rooted in her present state. Her bitterness, her remoteness..."
    "Was today a snapshot, no matter how momentary, of what Hikari's old life was like?"
    "As for herself, Hikari seems fed up with dwelling on it."
    hikari "How about chess, then? You were making progress, so it'd be a shame to stop now."
    takeru "I'll learn from the master then. Let me just set up the board."
    "I take Hikari's carved set off the shelf and put the pieces in their place, thimble-for-a-knight included."
    "While I hope she does decide to come out more often, I like this Hikari as well."
    "The consistent Hikari. Impatient, maybe, but compassionate. Almost the first person I met at Mirako."
    "It probably won't be long before she shuts me down on the chess board again, but I'm still glad I met her."

label day09b:

    "When I wake up on Sunday, Kenta's nowhere to be found."
    "Good. He'd probably mistake this for Monday and bludgeon me in the head until I straight passed out again."
    "And that'd interrupt the only good sleep I've gotten in ages. With Mana back and Hikari around, slowly Mirako is approaching normalcy."
    "Normalcy, despite all the buildup for the cultural festival."
    "Despite Natsumi's screwloose recruitment scheme. Despite Hagami's usual weirdness."
    "And despite the fact that Hikari would appear to be a ghost?"
    "Never mind."
    "I notice my friend the horned toad is staring at me again from his jar. He seems to be telling me that I'll never know normalcy again."
    takeru "I can try, though. Or maybe I just have to hope."
    takeru "...Why am I talked to a dead frog?"
    "I stand up and rub my forehead. Definitely a headache coming on."
    "There are better things to do."
    "I have some schoolwork to do and then it'll probably be an all-day affair dragging things up the hill for Meiko."
    
    "She's waiting at the fork in the road, as promised."
    "About this time on a school day, I'd be escaping Meiko and Natsumi to head to the old library. I realize now I was actually looking forward to seeing her. Probably because there's no Natsumi around."
    takeru "Meiko! Hey."
    meiko "Hello Takeru! Good morning."
    takeru "Hope I didn't keep you waiting."
    meiko "I'm more glad it wasn't me keeping you waiting."
    takeru "You must keep stricter schedules then Kenta..."
    meiko "Of course. You wouldn't want your class rep to be anything less than exact, would you?"
    meiko "Ready to go?"
    "Meiko has a handbag over her shoulder and a thin smile on her face. But the rest of her face looks thin as well."
    takeru "You don't look so great."
    meiko "Hm?"
    takeru "Er, I don't mean... You always look great, but, are you feeling alright?"
    meiko "It's really nothing."
    takeru "There might be a bug going around. If you tell me where to find whatever we're supposed to be moving, I can just do it myself if you need."
    meiko "I didn't get enough sleep last night is all."
    takeru "Oh yeah?"
    meiko "...More planning."
    "Meiko laughs it off."
    meiko "It's nothing I can't handle of course. Thanks for your concern though."
    meiko "Should we get going?"
    "And we start back down the hill."
    
    "It's not too far to town from here, and it's actually nice out as well. Although uphill, when the sun is out in full force on the return trip, I doubt it'll be this pleasant."
    meiko "Thanks again for helping out with all this festival work, Takeru. I know it must be hard to handle on top of classes."
    takeru "Oh, I've got enough time to spare. No idea how you can do all of this, plus the student council stuff, plus stay top of the class."
    meiko "It's expected, right?"
    takeru "Er, I guess. I mean Natsumi pretty much says you can do anything."
    meiko "And do it correctly."
    "Meiko emphasizes that last word. \"Correctly.\" It's a little strange."
    "As if sensing my confusion she changes the subject."
    meiko "The forms handed back were all correct as well, except for that one fake. You did good work."
    takeru "Actually..."
    takeru "About that form."
    meiko "The incorrect one? With the fake club?"
    takeru "Yeah. I've thought about it a bit..."
    "Although I have been thinking about it for the past few days (mostly wondering what on earth Hagami's up to), this particular idea only occurred to me now."
    "It's probably borne out of the way Meiko keeps calling the club \"fake.\" It's just unregistered. Didn't Mana tell me of course it's real? Because they're just... people that meet? Isn't that the definition?"
    takeru "That unregistered club..."
    takeru "Did you throw out the application or anything?"
    meiko "No, I still have it. Not on me, of course, but it's sorted into the documents folders in the council room."
    takeru "Can you like, reserve it? Keep the form around, and then if the club suddenly becomes un-fake, er, registers, you file it?"
    takeru "I don't exactly the forms are for, but..."
    meiko "General student display applications. If you need to pay for supplies, we can cover some of it. If you need space to display or perform, it needs to be reserved. And we need descriptions for the program. And times to put together the - "
    takeru "Right. Then can you keep the space open or something?"
    meiko "...Why?"
    takeru "I'm not quite sure. It could be important."
    takeru "I know the girl who filed it. Hagami. She's in our year, so I can probably just talk to her and sort this whole thing out."
    meiko "You're really not making any sense. I thought that paper was someone scamming the festival's budget. And reserving space anything would be, well, irregular."
    meiko "I don't like anything irregular. Especially not for this festival."
    "She glances over shoulder at me. It's the same calm and composed Meiko as ever, but, there's something ever so slightly odd in the way she seems emotional about this."
    "Finally, she sighs."
    meiko "I'll keep it around. If your friend gets her act together maybe we can make an exception. Try to be quick about it though, alright?"
    takeru "Thanks Meiko. I knew you'd get it."
    meiko "I try to understand, really... It's that, well, sometimes..."
    meiko "I hate making exceptions."
    takeru "You wouldn't be you if you didn't."
    meiko "That's... Thanks anyways."
    meiko "Maybe you don't know, but there's a lot riding on the festival this year. Everything has to go off perfectly, and if anything's out of place, it all comes down on me."
    takeru "Because of what happened last year?"
    meiko "Please don't bring that up. But yes. I was involved last year. It can't ever go like that again."
    "She takes a deep, shuddering breath."
    "Right. Hikari. Last time I brought her up, Meiko seemed all out of sorts. And today Mieko just has an aura of tension. Maybe best not to ask for details."
    "Although I can almost put it together on my own. It'd make sense that the administration's paying attention this year if something that happened last year that led to a student's death, even indirectly. A fire, right?"
    "The convenience store and public library come into view along the last bend in the hill road."
    "And there's that coffee shop we visited last time. \"Cat's Corner Cafe.\" Meiko points it out."
    meiko "Hm, I'm a bit hungry actually. I haven't eaten yet."
    takeru "Neither have I."
    meiko "Let's stop in for a few minutes then? We wouldn't want you working on an empty stomach."
    
    "The cafe's what I remembered it to be. Low bustle. Quiet talk. A few business-looking types in their twenties work on laptops."
    "That's right. This is the place I first took in the whole picture of the new Meiko."
    "Everyone's crowded into the tables at the back, but Meiko manage to grab a booth for ourselves."
    takeru "You're just having a coffee?"
    meiko "Maybe I'll have lunch a little later. I don't think I could eat."
    takeru "Wait, I thought you even said... Never mind."
    meiko "Is your sandwich alright?"
    takeru "Yeah, it's good, if you want some. I feel kind of guilty eating it though if you don't have anything."
    meiko "Really, enjoy. Don't worry about me."
    takeru "Right, I guess that's pointless. You've pretty much shown you can take care of yourself."
    "She laughs."
    "There's a spiced smell in the air, almost like a cidre. Must be some seasonal drink they have in stock. It mixes with the fumes from Meiko's coffee."
    takeru "I guess I really should be thanking you instead of worrying about you."
    meiko "Hm?"
    takeru "For worrying about me. I'm trying to think where I'd be without you."
    meiko "Without me?"
    takeru "At Mirako, I mean."
    takeru "I didn't know anyone. Coming from Tohoku, it was... I couldn't tell anyone about that, so, just having someone around that understood that..."
    takeru "I'm not sure where I'm going with this, but, I was just entirely lost for a while, especially before I came to Mirako."
    takeru "If I didn't run into you I'd probably be out, I don't know, catching frogs with Kenta today. Or locked up in my room feeling sorry for myself."
    takeru "To tell the truth I avoided you those first couple days. I was worried you'd hate me."
    meiko "What a funny thing to think."
    meiko "Takeru, the only person pulling you out of Tohoku and into Mirako is yourself. If you're used to it here, the credit is yours."
    "At first I think she's trying to say something uplifting, or else trying at some graciously self-deprecating take on \"you're welcome,\" but... She's downright scowling. I worry for the safety of her coffee cup."
    meiko "It makes me really uncomfortable when you thank me. So please stop it."
    takeru "Er..."
    meiko "I can't tell if you're sincere or mocking me."
    takeru "How would I be mocking you?"
    meiko "Are you an idiot?"
    takeru "What?"
    "She takes a deep breath, then speaks in a monotone, almost faster than I can keep up."
    meiko "I've been sabotaging you this whole time. Why do you think that nothing you can do is good enough? Why do you think you're here right now instead of with people who actually care about you? Where do you think Meiko got that yearbook?"
    meiko "Who else would even have that? She asked if I knew anything so I just gave it to her. I knew what I was doing."
    meiko "And you can still talk to me everyday and eat with me here and thank me like I'm that 'perfect person' everyone else sees."
    "Meiko runs out of breath and then chokes something back. The whole time she doesn't take her eyes off me."
    takeru "I don't get it. You just didn't get enough sleep. You can't - "
    meiko "It's that sort of dishonesty that got us into this."
    takeru "Then... I don't understand why you'd..."
    "She takes a deep breath, then closes her eyes. There's finally some sense of her old voice back. Less accusatory."
    meiko "Do you remember the day you left?"
    takeru "I left?"
    meiko "For Tohoku. Four or five years ago."
    "I shut my eyes but draw a blank."
    "I keep them shut."
    meiko "It doesn't matter if you do. The point is..."
    meiko "No, it does matter. I'm sorry, if I lose momentum now I'll just quit."
    takeru "Say what you need to say."
    "My eyes are still closed."
    "To be honest, I'm frightened. I feel like the mask has slipped, and I've glimpsed something unpleasant, something better left unseen."
    "And that spice smell is back, maybe chestnuts, maybe something else mulled. It's not helping me parse what Meiko is trying to say."
    meiko "I was living with my aunt's family then. My parents were gone for over a year by then."
    meiko "You have to remember the field."
    "The field?"
    meiko "It wasn't a park or anything. I lived three doors down. You were practically across the street. You played baseball there."
    "Now something comes back. A cloudless day. The field really wasn't a park, just vacant space and a grassy patch cleared below where the high voltage powerlines ran overhead."
    "Meiko seems to have found her voice. She continues, and I half-hear. That one image seems to stick. That's where I grew up."
    
    "A cloudless day. A grassy patch cleared below the powerlines. My house is across the way."
    "It's impossible to tell the season. The sky, the foliage, everything is in vivid but indeterminate color."
    "Today I play first base. I'd never pitch with these guys. I blow the middle school team away as is. They wouldn't stand a chance."
    "Or... At least I thought I was playing first base. I guess I'm just watching for now. Shun's pitching. Looks like Yuji's up to bat. Easy out."
    "There's only one unfamiliar face here."
    meiko "..."
    "She just watches, like me. But only for a second. She's headed across the street. That's my house."
    "She knocks at the door."
    meiko "I-is Takeru back?"
    "Not even a three second pause, then -"
    meiko "N-no, I get it. Sorry."
    "How many times must she have gotten that answer?"
    "Meiko starts to cross back over the street."
    "There's something about my house that catches my eye though."
    "It's certainly, absolutely my house. I can't point out any specific detail (or even point out any details at all), but I know it on an instinctive level."
    "But there's one aspect that's different, one object that shouldn't be there."
    "A sign, in the yard. \"FOR SALE.\""
    "I guess that's obvious though, isn't it? My parents moved to be closer to Tohoku a few months after I'd left. I don't remember ever seeing the sign there though."
    "Once I left for Tohoku, I never came back here."
    "Putting that aside, I turn back to Meiko. She's on the side of the road now, heading up the street."
    takeru "Meiko?"
    takeru "Hey! Meiko!"
    "She doesn't respond, just keeps meandering down the road, past the loosely packed houses."
    "I remember them. The first on the left, where that mean elderly couple lived... I see it now as black, maybe a harsh violet. We used to joke it was haunted."
    "Katsumi's house next. He used to be the pitcher before he went off to school to be an engineer or something. That's when I started learning the position."
    "Then Meiko's house. Well, her aunt and uncle's house, anyway. A dull tan, spotless paint. It looks average, just like it always did. It stands in contrast to the hyperreality of everything else around me."
    "She enters."
    "Somehow I'm inside too. Somewhere indistinct. But somewhere close enough to catch her face."
    meiko "..."
    "The younger her. Chin low instead of high."
    "There's a shout from down the hall. Her aunt?"
    "I want the Meiko I know to straighten up and reply, with that same voice of reason she always has. But the Meiko I remember just trembles."
    "She talks to the floor."
    meiko "You yell at me when I stay in. You yell at me when I go out."
    meiko "I swore I'd try harder not to let you down."
    "She walks upstairs as the shouting continues. This time I find something familiar in her eyes. Resolution."
    "I realize this must be her room. There's a stack of sketchbooks on a nighttable, and a bookshelf with about twenty books, all vividly colored. They swirl."
    "There's a bed on the far side, but it's disordered and wrinkled. Meiko straightens it."
    "Then she takes a seat at the desk."
    "It's heavy thing, made of dark wood with brass handles on the drawers, like something salvaged from 50's accounting office. It can't be hers. Her uncle's property, probably. It hasn't been too long since Meiko moved in here, after all."
    "She starts writing."
    "At first it's just a straight line across the page. Then words form, but I can't read anything. The writing's distorted into droplets."
    "She's crying. Not sobbing, tears just silently falls as she puts the pen to the page, that look of determination that's now so familiar on her face."
    "By the end, there's only one sentence I can read."
    "I will prove to you and the rest of them that I'm strong."
    "Meiko signs the page. Is that... a letter?"
    "And then she fills in the addressee, the name at the top."
    "And she turns around, stares at me, and in the exact same moment, she writes my name and says it to my face."
    meiko "Takeru."
    takeru "What - "
    takeru "How are you... I thought..."
    
    meiko "Takeru."
    takeru "I hear you."
    "I realize why I recognized her determined expression immediately. It's because it's the one she's making at me, now, at the Cat's Corner Cafe, while I try to figure out what the hell just happened."
    meiko "Please bear with me."
    takeru "No, keep going, sorry. I just... remembered something. I think."
    takeru "You were saying that every night..."
    meiko "I wrote you every night that first week, even before I realized where you'd left to."
    meiko "Nobody told me, definitely not my aunt."
    meiko "She was absolutely terrible, you know. There's an inheritance problem, and, her sister, my mother..."
    meiko "I didn't live with them because they were charitable people. I hated every minute of it, and until you left, I never realized how absolutely alone I was."
    takeru "I was an idiot in middle school."
    meiko "You still are. I've not looking out for, Takeru. I never was. That's all there was to it."
    takeru "All there was... what?"
    meiko "All I've wanted to do was show I didn't need you the same way you clearly didn't need me."
    meiko "I probably wouldn't be here at Mirako if you had responded even once to those letters."
    "Did I read them?"
    meiko "It's been what I've been trying to accomplish here since day one. I don't need to rely on you, I don't need to rely on my relatives, my parents' money, or anything else. I can do it all, and I can do it without any of that."
    "She slams her empty coffee glass down on the table like it's the most disgusting thing she's ever tasted."
    meiko "That's what I thought anyway. Guess not."
    meiko "I bungled it last year and look what happened. Now let's guess the casualties this year."
    takeru "That can't possibly be your - "
    "If I'm looking to comfort her (am I?) this is probably not the best approach."
    takeru "I'm sorry, Meiko, I really am. I was an idiot. I didn't know you were under so much pressure."
    meiko "Oh I got myself into that, out of some grudge against you, and everyone else it looks like."
    takeru "Grudge... That first day, right here in this cafe, I thought you said..."
    meiko "I didn't forgive you. I hated you. I think I still do. I don't even know."
    meiko "It's wonderful to see you again. But when you left I went through years of hell. I want you to find yourself at home here. But I keep sabotaging you and setting you up with the most thankless tasks I can imagine."
    "I can't tell who I'm talking to. There were always cracks, but something unknown came out of Meiko's shell. It's not the her I remember, not the model student she always tries to be, but someone else."
    "The only constant is that determination. She continues. I doubt she'll stop until she's said everything she can."
    meiko "I can't deal with you, and Natsumi, and the festival, and... her."
    meiko "I knew I couldn't pretend forever and now I'm stuck. Valedictorian, good school, the law degree, academics..."
    meiko "There was never a plan. It's just a dead end."
    "And Meiko sits there, staring. She's challenging me to respond."
    "But I'm at a loss for words. It's not that I'm totally taken by surprise. There was always something just slightly off about Meiko, just off enough that I thought I could ignore it."
    "It's not that I'm at a loss for words, but I think that anything I could say wouldn't properly communicate how I feel or what I want to do."
    "I want to apologize but it'd just sound hollow. I want to forgive her for setting Natsumi on me, but I'm the one who should be asking forgiveness. I want to tell her to hang in there, but the last thing she wants is my pity."
    "And I don't pity her. Is this... empathy? Is that why I could see what she was describing so clearly? Or did I remember that scene? For a moment was I back home, back then?"
    "No. I've always been sitting here in a cafe in Mirako. And now I need to figure out how to deal with this."
    takeru "Where's that place we're supposed to pick up the rental equipment? And when do we have to be there?"
    "Meiko snorts and pushes away her empty coffee."
    meiko "Haha, Takeru, you don't have to keep playing along. Go home. I'll work it out at the office and someone on the staff can rent a truck and come down to pick it up."
    takeru "I'm serious. We're already in town, so let's just get it done. Don't think I'm helping you out of guilt or debt, or... whatever."
    meiko "Well then?"
    takeru "It sounds like you actually could use the help."
    "She hesitates, as if to refuse, then takes a few breaths."
    meiko "Fine. It's not like I can avoid you forever anyway. There's always school tomorrow."
    takeru "Don't remind me."
    meiko "The rental place is maybe five minutes away. Let me just grab a sandwich to eat on the way there."
    "She smiles. It's grim, but it's something."
    
    "The equipment in question is a massive barbecue grill and a pushcart to go with it."
    "I can see why Meiko talked about getting a truck. This thing would definitely not fit in a car, and it's a two person job to cart it up the road to Mirako."
    "There's a level patch of dirt by the guardrail. We guide the cart and grill over and take a moment to cool off."
    "Meiko catches her breath. I'm pretty sure I'm sweating through my shirt."
    takeru "Having someone pick this up with a truck isn't sounding so bad... How on earth did you move this last year?"
    meiko "Natsumi and I did it. Can you believe?"
    takeru "Actually yes. Well, no. I have no idea how you conned her into doing actual work."
    meiko "Haha, Natsumi is easy. You just have no idea how to deal with her."
    takeru "We'll be lucky if this only takes another hour."
    "I'm about ready to start pushing that terrible cart again, but Meiko's looking out over the guardrail. Instead of calling, I walk over."
    "It's the same spot we stopped at a month ago now. Instead of the usual Mirako shallow hill, the ground falls away into a cliff. There aren't any buildings out that way. Just fields, farms, meadows.. and mountains."
    meiko "..."
    takeru "..."
    "There's that deja vu again."
    meiko "Ready to go?"
    takeru "Yeah."
    "She keeps looking at me though. There's no animosity, there, just... caution? Confusion?"
    "I'm sure to her I look the same way."
    "If before I was uneasy, now this is uncharted territory. I'm not sure where I stand with her. I'm not sure what I think of her."
    "But I think we both feel that way. We both know each others' past, at least, for better or for worse."
    "So it seems we're united in our unease. So even though now I'm even less sure what exactly we are to each other, it feels closer."
    "I sigh and we take our places at the cart, never quite looking at each other, and we get back to work moving the grill."
    "I might complain, but I don't regret it."
    
    "By the time I'm almost back to the dorm, the sun is low in the sky."
    "Meiko and I really didn't have much to say other than goodbyes after finishing the job, and I'm sure it's going to take another day or two to process everything."
    "I open to the door to my room. My plan is to take a nap, then if there's still time left, head -"
    "WHACK."
    "I walk face first into a wooden beam."
    takeru "Kenta, what the hell?"
    kenta "Good afternoon, Takeru."
    takeru "I left this morning and it was a zoo in here, now I come back and it's a lumberyard, and you - "
    kenta "Good afternoon, Takeru."
    takeru "Good afternoon, Kenta. Now why is there wood all over the place?"
    kenta "I'd think it's obvious. Didn't we go over this?"
    "He gestures at the assorted planks and boards scattered around the room. A few are attached to each other at 90 degree angles and standing up from the floor, including the beam I just walked into, which is effectively barring the door at face-level."
    "Actually, maybe it's lucky for Kenta that there's a two by four preventing me from getting at him."
    takeru "How did we 'go over' this? Are you making a barricade? Are you you expecting me to storm the room or something?"
    kenta "You told me to do this."
    takeru "Right. Okay. Just explain what you're doing. Simply."
    kenta "I'm building a cabinet. We're out of display space."
    takeru "Oh."
    takeru "There's not enough room on my dresser for frogs so you're building a cabinet."
    kenta "Yes."
    takeru "..."
    takeru "You know it's possible to just buy these things, right? How did you even get this stuff up to..."
    "I duck under the board that hit me in the face and pick up a ten page multilingual instruction booklet off the floor."
    takeru "What step are we on? The sooner I have my dresser back, the better."
    kenta "You don't keep any clothes in it, so I wouldn't call it your dresser, precisely. We have a good system going so let's not spoil things by getting possessive."
    takeru "Just me know what I need to do before I lose my patience again."
    kenta "Hold this steady."
    takeru "That things six feet long."
    kenta "Yes, it is. I need to screw this bracket on."
    kenta "..."
    kenta "Can you please stop that wobbling? Thank you."
    takeru "This was not a great idea..."
    "Not a great idea, but not a terrible way to spend the afternoon and evening either. I'd almost enjoy it if I wasn't already sore from pushing that grill all the way to school."
    "When Meiko and I parted ways, we didn't have much to say to each other. While I'm less uneasy now, there still feels like a huge gap between us. I'm more concerned with what I'll have to say when I see her tomorrow."
    "Luckily Kenta's exercise in cabinetry is a distraction. And when we finish, we have something to show for it."
    kenta "Not bad."
    takeru "Not bad for something that was a pile of junk a few hours ago."
    kenta "And useful too."
    kenta "Takeru, you have a black eye. Were you in a fight?"
    takeru "The only fight I was in was with your new furniture. It'll all be worth it if don't have to look through frog jars every morning though."
    kenta "I'll need a while to come up with a good plan for organizing everything though. This isn't something we'd want to rush."
    takeru "Does this mean that I get my dresser - "
    "But Kenta's already busy shuffling around his insects, preserved amphibians, and stacks of clothing from one dresser, to the other, to the newly constructed cabinet."
    "It looks like the top shelf is reserved for dragonflies. The cabinet drawer is for socks. One giant moth sits alone on the cabinet top."
    "I sit back and watch the whirlwind. But when things finally settle, my dresser is still occupied."
    takeru "Hello old friend."
    kenta "Are you talking to that lizard?"
    takeru "He's staring at me. Again."
    kenta "Takeru, I'm worried about your health. You've been acting very strangely lately."
    takeru "I'm not actually talking to the lizard, you know."
    kenta "Then who are you talking to?"
    takeru "You can be impossible sometimes, Kenta. Thanks for getting some extra storage space, I guess."
    kenta "You helped put it together, but, you're welcome."
    "He checks his watch."
    kenta "But now it's time to eat."
    
    "Kenta falls asleep immediately after dinner."
    "Actually, he looked exhausted. Who knows how long he was struggling to put all those shelves together before I showed up?"
    "I should probably turn in as well."
    "But, for some reason, I can't sleep."
    "What exactly is holding me up? There's no huge problem I'm going to have to deal with any time soon. I figured out what was up with Meiko, right?"
    takeru "..."
    "I sit up in bed."
    "If I had to describe my mood, it'd be somewhere between confusion and guilt. I honestly thought Meiko had forgiven me, and now it turns out she despises me."
    "But she felt so guilty about that that she decided to be honest, so... Did I lose a friend or gain one?"
    "Lifting myself out of bed, I open the top drawer of what was once my dresser. I expected shirts but I got dried beetles."
    "Next drawer down is the emergency supplies. I guess the flashlight won't hurt if I don't want to wake Kenta up."
    "The rest of the drawers hold more shirts, dull brown chemical bottles, and an exhaustive set of differently size tweezers."
    "Taking care not to make any noise opening anything, I start searching the new cabinet."
    "Found it."
    "It's an cardboard box, not taped shut, but closed with each tab folded under the other. Looks like I really haven't touched this stuff since Tohoku."
    "There's some old clothes. Mostly uniforms, but my baseball jersies are tucked in there too, both home and away. Plus my glove. I try not to look at those."
    "The other half holds papers. There are some brochures in there, plus some scorecards I filled out from a few college games I used to go to. I rifle through old tests and a scouting report."
    "At the very bottom are the envelopes. There's maybe 30 in total, all addressed to me, signed, and postmarked. All of them are sealed, too."
    "She said if I'd replied, even once, to one of these letters, she wouldn't be at Mirako."
    "Why is she here in the first place?"
    "I flip one of the envelopes around, back to front, then hold it to the flashlight. It looks like lined paper in there, maybe two pages."
    "I can't remember why I never even opened them. There were a few friends from back home I called once or twice, but, at the time, it seemed utterly irrelevant. There were plenty of people, dozens of people, all around me that wanted to know me."
    "And they were all like me. Either baseball players, or at the Tohoku feeder school, baseball nerds at minimum. Of course they wanted to call me their friend. I was a top prospect."
    "I keep turning the letter over and over in my hand."
    "What good what it do to open it now? It seems like picking a scab. It seems like the letters should be burned or buried, or just stuffed in a box and never looked at again, like the rest of my relics from Tohoku."
    "Reading them now changes nothing."
    "That confusion steadily gives away to the guilt, then just to an oppressive regret."
    "If I could redo things, I would've made a different choice."
    "Would I have even gone to Tohoku? If I knew how it'd end? With a total waste of talent, the burning of all my bridges, and a psychosis diagnosis to cap it off?"
    "If I had the chance, I'd do it differently. I'd fix things. Who knows if they can even be fixed now?"

label day09c:

    "I drag my head out from under my pillow. There's something wrong this morning."
    "I'm tired, I was up to all hours last night, but that's not it..."
    "Kenta's shuffling around somewhere by the door."
    "Wait. If Kenta's already awake... why hasn't he attacked me yet?"
    takeru "Kenta... Kenta what time is it?"
    kenta "Good morning, Takeru. Good morning!"
    takeru "Good morning. What's got you all worked up?"
    "I check my alarm. There's no jars in the way for once, but..."
    "Why is the display blank?"
    takeru "Oh no... It must've gotten unplugged yesterday when we were moving things around."
    kenta "I tried to wake you up but you but nothing worked."
    takeru "Did you try calling me? Or maybe grabbing my shoulder or something?"
    kenta "No."
    kenta "I tapped you a few times but... it didn't work."
    "Thank you, pillow, for saving me from Kenta's onslaught. Except..."
    "Kenta's dressed. He's practically out the door already."
    takeru "It's late, isn't it?"
    kenta "Really late."
    takeru "Okay, sorry, sorry, give me five minutes."
    "I start throwing open drawers to find my clothes but of course only Kenta knows where anything is kept in this godforsaken room, and he's too busy checking his watch and fidgeting to help."
    "In retrospect it was a terrible mistake to dig out all of my old Tohoku stuff last night. I'm not even out the door before I'm feeling drowsy."
    "Kenta's practically running up the hill road, and it's all I can do to keep up. Looks like we actually might be late for once. At least the cold air might wake me up."
    
    "I make the start of homeroom by the skin of my teeth."
    "Looks like Meiko's already given her talk, and everyone else is here but the teacher, except for -"
    natsumi "Heya Takeru."
    "Natsumi sits down two seconds before I can take my seat."
    natsumi "You're pretty late. Not quite enough to be a delinquent, but, keep up the good work."
    takeru "I don't need to hear that from you."
    natsumi "I ran morning practice today. What's your excuse?"
    takeru "Er..."
    "I'm trying to figure out how to explain the frogs, the furniture, and the roommate that make up the warzone of my dorm, but it's too early and I really don't want to talk to Natsumi."
    takeru "Long story."
    natsumi "Were you spying on our practice? You know, you're welcome to join at - "
    takeru "Not interested. No way."
    "It seems Meiko didn't talk Natsumi out of this hairbrained recruitment scam. But I don't know why I thought she would. She started this, after all."
    natsumi "And who gave you that black eye?"
    takeru "A piece of wood."
    natsumi "A piece of wood wielded by a hooligan who attacked you last night on your way home from - "
    takeru "A piece of wood wielded by a piece of furniture."
    natsumi "Come on, Takeru, that was your chance to brag. I'm not sure I want a pitcher who even gets beat up by inanimate objects."
    takeru "Good, go find some other guy and leave me alone."
    natsumi "You're no fun this morning."
    "I don't want to be fun. I just want to survive a few classes without passing out at my desk. Looks like that might take a miracle."
    "A desk over, Meiko just silently watches Natsumi's repeated failure to start a conversation with me."
    "I don't really want to dwell on Meiko now either. Just looking at her reminds me of those letters, and that hyperrealistic memory of the younger Meiko writing them. A memory I probably shouldn't have in the first place, when I think about it."
    "It really was the strangest thing. I could've sworn I was there, that I saw those events in person. When I close my eyes I almost see it again. There were no details, no real colors, but everything was just... familiar."
    "I must've drifted off. When I open my eyes, I'm still drowsy and it looks as if half the room has taken on that vivid-yet-colorless quality."
    "For instance... Meiko's hair is a deep brown. But I can't see it. I just remember it that way."
    meiko "...but you should still have a chance, if you work hard."
    natsumi "We're underdogs, for sure. But there's always a chance. Especially if my secret plan goes through."
    meiko "Good luck then. Let me know if there's anything I can do for you, if you need help with classes in the meantime, or anything like that."
    natsumi "Oh I don't care about class much. The tournament's way more important at this point. Just worry about your pet festival."
    "At least they're talking again. That's one more piece of life back to normal."
    "I must be really tired. This whole morning just feels abnormal, to the extreme. Like I've already lived through today once and now all I'm doing is watching the rerun."
    "The lesson is totally lost on me."
    "After an hour of this slow motion, there's a bell. Next class. It's going to be a long day."
    
    "I guess this must be physics again?"
    "I'm struggling to take notes when there's a whisper next to me."
    hikari "Hello. Enjoying your morning, Takeru?"
    takeru "...!"
    hikari "Surprised?"
    "Her voice is low, but, still, she isn't being subtle. Shouldn't the rest of the class see her there, sitting beside me? And the students in front and behind us must hear something."
    hikari "Hm, you look a little pale. Are you not glad to see me?"
    takeru "..."
    "I do my best to talk without raising my voice a sliver above what I need to."
    takeru "Sorry, I... I should probably pay attention to class is all."
    hikari "I doubt you could even tell me what class this is."
    "It's physics. I know I have physics right after homeroom. I remember that much. But I keep quiet so I don't end up embarassing myself if that turns out wrong."
    hikari "I'm starting to think it's that you'd rather not see me."
    takeru "That's not..."
    hikari "Think about it. I told you what stacks up to be my biggest secret. That I'm not actually here. That took a lot of faith. I had to trust you wouldn't up and leave me."
    hikari "Well you didn't jump out of your chair and run screaming immediately, but..."
    hikari "You've been back to see me, what, once since then?"
    hikari "Don't think I can't take a hint."
    takeru "This isn't a good time."
    hikari "Of course it isn't. That's why I'm here now."
    hikari "Because, Takeru, trust works both ways. Why don't you think I deserve to know anything about you?"
    hikari "You encouraged me to actually try talking to people again. Well, I've spoken to Meiko. You might know her."
    "I can only stare at Hikari. She looks nothing like I remember. It's all wrong. Even her expression is stolen from somewhere else, with that wide flat smile, serene, gloating, utterly false. Just daring me to ask what it is that she knows that I don't."
    hikari "You underestimated Meiko, Takeru. Everyone knows now. Thirty letters. And three years? She knew no one in that town after you left, except her aunt, maybe, who hated her almost as much as she started to hate you."
    hikari "It seems to be a trend, doesn't it? Someone trusts you. Maybe even someone you pretend is important to you. You're practically the only one that remembers that I exist, so of course I have to put all my hopes on you."
    hikari "Then you just... wander off. You're too caught up in your own problems to really care about anyone around you, no matter how much you kid yourself. Didn't you call Meiko your best friend here? What a joke that was."
    hikari "Maybe if you spent less time feeling sorry for yourself, you'd notice these things."
    takeru "Why are you - "
    takeru "What do you want?"
    hikari "I do as I like. If everyone wakes up tomorrow and forgets me, what does it matter anyway? There are no consequences."
    "I'm praying that tomorrow I won't remember this ever happened."
    "I can't even argue with Hikari. For one thing, this is a terrible place to do anything. If I raise my voice, probably everyone would only see my talking to myself."
    "Plus I can't exactly say Hikari's wrong. How is she able to do that? I can't even articulate why I'm uncomfortable with Meiko, and Hikari too now. She read my subconscious and then slapped me in the face with it."
    "After a few seconds of silence, I glance at Hikari again."
    "But she's gone."
    "Next to me is Meiko, flat smile on her face, watching the teacher at the board."
    "At some point Hikari must've left."
    "Wait, which side of me was she even sitting on?"
    "And I start to realize I'm forgetting already. It couldn't be that... I've start to lose memory of Hikari now?"
    "Was Meiko there this whole time? It couldn't have been her talking to me, could it? No way."
    "I'm saved by the chime of the lunch bell. I need to get out of here, fast."
    "Of course, I'm immediately defeated by Natsumi's talent for finding the exact moments where I want to talk to her the least."
    natsumi "Well, well, Takeru."
    takeru "Sorry, Natsumi, I'm kind of hungry so..."
    natsumi "Who was that you were talking to there?"
    takeru "What?"
    takeru "I wasn't talking to anyone. What did you even see?"
    natsumi "So it was Meiko! Knew it."
    "Natsumi has the most infuriating smirk I have ever seen in my life."
    natsumi "But if you're just looking to get to lunch I won't hold you up. You know, you're welcome to eat with me and the guys whenever you want. I'm sure a few of them would love to - "
    takeru "Nope, sorry. No thanks."
    natsumi "You're missing out."
    natsumi "See you later!"
    "With her out of my way, I'm out of the classroom as quickly as possible. I keep an eye out for Meiko and Hikari, but both seem to have vanished."
    "What on earth is Hikari thinking? I've been running on information overload since yesterday and it's clearly taking its toll. At least the drowsiness is gone but I'm left with a killer headache."
    "I just need to find somewhere quiet to process everything. I'll head for the old library."
    
    "Unfortunately, to get to the old library, I need to pass that disused wing that makes up Hikari's territory."
    "No sign of her."
    "But this place seems strange, still. That unreality that's stuck with me since yesterday morning feels strong. I don't recognize any of the doorways, where before I could point out the tearoom, the piano room, the old art classroom..."
    "I could probably still do it now, but I'm just counting the doors. They look the same as ever, so why am I stuck?"
    "Whatever."
    "When I arrive at the library, it looks like the supernatural club is back down to one member."
    takeru "Hey Hagami."
    hagami "...Hello."
    takeru "I guess Mana's still sick?"
    "Hagami nods."
    "She's reading at the table, per usual, but when she looks up, I flinch. I could've sworn it was Hikari in front of me."
    "Hagami squints at me."
    takeru "Sorry. I didn't get much sleep."
    hagami "Oh?"
    takeru "I just got to bed late. Some stuff came up on Sunday."
    "When I don't elaborate, Hagami goes back to reading."
    "I take out my lunch. It's not very appealing, but maybe I'm just low on energy. I should at least wake up a bit."
    "The quiet in here has started to grow in me over the past week or two. I wonder if Hagami prefers silence and just puts on the radio for me and Mana?"
    "Probably not, if she had that music tome on hand. I'm not sure if she was joking when she said old music was a hobby of hers. I'm going to guess not."
    "Regardless, the radio is off today, so it's up to me to speak."
    takeru "Hey..."
    hagami "Hm?"
    takeru "About your festival application... I talked to Meiko about it, she's my friend on the student council. She's going to keep it around, but, without registering the supernatural club, they won't accept it."
    hagami "That, well..."
    hagami "It's not important. Really."
    "That one I can read as a lie. She's blushing."
    takeru "I know Mana wasn't so enthusiastic about it, but it looks like the only way."
    takeru "What's stopping you?"
    hagami "No one would join this club. It's not really a club. We... don't do anything."
    takeru "Not true. I distinctly remember hunting ghosts."
    hagami "Oh. You can join then. We have an initiation rite though..."
    takeru "Okay I'm not joining. I'm guessing this little initiation involves robes and pig latin and all that?"
    "Hagami smirks."
    hagami "...It takes four people anyway."
    takeru "Right."
    hagami "It's really not important."
    hagami "...You didn't tell Mana right?"
    takeru "No."
    takeru "If it's not important, then why can't I - "
    "Hagami flips up the book she's reading. It's another oversized hardcover so it effectively walls off her half of the table."
    takeru "Fine."
    "I can't tell what she's reading today though. There doesn't seem to be a title on the spine, and the whole thing is bound in vivid fabric."
    "For some reason I can't tell the actual color. It's something bright and garish, but..."
    "All the rest of the books on the shelves are like it as well. They seem to blend together into a patch of color. Where did I see this before?"
    "Right. Meiko's room. She had a bookshelf, but it was all just a jumble. That... That was in that memory I shouldn't have."
    "I feel like someone kicked my legs out from under me. That's what today's felt like. It seems I don't have any control over my thought process, I'm just replaying what some beta-Takeru has already done."
    "I really need to wake up."
    "I shake my head and look up, but Hagami's still hiding behind her book wall."
    "But as I watch, a hand darts out and flicks a knob on the radio. I guess she's done talking for today."
    meiko "Takeru."
    takeru "What the - "
    meiko "Dear Takeru..."
    "I jump up and look around for Meiko. Hagami only stares at me, nonplussed."
    takeru "Did you not just hear - "
    "Then I realize. It's a recording. Meiko's voice is coming from the radio. Someone (her?) made a CD of her voice, and Hagami is playing it back. No wonder she doesn't look surprised."
    meiko "Dear Takeru, how are things at Tohoku Junior High? I know you must really busy because I haven't heard from you in so..."
    "I freeze. A fight-or-flight instinct kicks in."
    meiko "...and yes, it's been painful. You've read all the other letters so you already know what it's like here. Me against the world."
    meiko "But I feel like I haven't thanked you yet. If you hadn't run away, I'd still just be a mopey girl. I'm stronger now."
    meiko "Before I was sad all the time. I'm not depressed any more, just furious. One day I'll get even. You'll think I'm there for you, and then..."
    takeru "Hagami where did you get this?"
    "But she's hiding behind her book again."
    meiko "... can't forgive you. But you'll never realize it, will you? You try to keep it a secret, but I know you betrayed me. I never forgot. And I know what happened, now, on that last day at Tohoku."
    meiko "That won't be a secret either. I know what happened then because it's happening again now."
    "Too weird. I thought it was Meiko reading a letter but it's some sort of threat. This can't be right. This can't possibly be right."
    takeru "Hagami, where did you get that CD? Is this a joke? This is the stupidest - "
    takeru "Shut it off, now. I'm not joking around."
    "Hagami peers over the cover of the book."
    "It's not Hagami. It's Hikari. No wonder I thought I saw her when I walked in. She's been here all along, she probably set up that taped message from Meiko..."
    "Then who was I talking to? The memory's all muddied up and I -"
    hikari "Takeru."
    "She addresses me from her seat at the table, partially obscured by the hardcover."
    hikari "I told you I could do anything. No consequences."
    takeru "Who are you?"
    hikari "Hagami."
    takeru "Do I look stupid? I might not have gotten enough sleep but I'm not that..."
    hagami "It's Hagami."
    "But it is Hagami that answers this time. When did she get behind me?"
    "I try to spin around, but I realize she's holding me, supporting me weight."
    hagami "Come on."
    takeru "R-right. Did you see..."
    hagami "Let's go."
    takeru "Hagami. It is you."
    "We leave the library."
    "The most urgent question: how much of that little speech was Hikari's doing? Was Hagami involved? Where do I even start with -"
    hagami "Come on."
    takeru "...You're frightened."
    hagami "Yeah."
    takeru "Hagami... Do you believe in ghosts?"
    hagami "There are no ghosts, Takeru."
    takeru "Then how do you explain the CD?"
    takeru "This isn't some practical joke, is it? Or has she been a practical joke from the beginning? You all pretend to ignore her, and then..."
    "Hagami's eyes are closed."
    "I realize she's talking, but, not to me."
    
    "Somehow I missed that we walked almost the entire way across the school, but at least I can pick up where we are. Outside a classroom?"
    kenta "How should I know? Why don't you ask him?"
    hagami "I..."
    kenta "You're taking your time about this."
    kenta "Good afternoon, Takeru. Are you alright?"
    takeru "Hey Kenta. There's just a lot on my mind. You saw I woke up late and then nothing's been making sense since..."
    "Hagami whispers something to me but I can't hear her."
    "Finally she manages to choke up some words to Kenta. I can't hear much of those, either."
    kenta "What?"
    kenta "No. I haven't. What makes you think - "
    hagami "H-he... Doesn't answer."
    kenta "Oh. Fine."
    kenta "Takeru, you take pills in the morning."
    takeru "Right..."
    kenta "Then..."
    "I already know the question that's coming, and about fifty puzzle pieces simultaneously slide into place. I also realize I'm an idiot."
    kenta "Did you take them this morning?"
    "Nope. Congratulations, Takeru, you've managed to utterly screw it up, again."
    "I'm stuck in the middle of a hallway somewhere, I have no idea how much of the past few hours only happened in my head, and of course, the only person to blame for this is myself. And I'm still having difficulty telling what's going on."
    "By the time I start managing to pay attention again, Kenta is talking at Hagami."
    kenta "Yes, I am, but just because I'm his roommate doesn't mean..."
    kenta "I would really like to but class starts in two minutes and I need to go. I can't be late. You can do this just as well, right?"
    kenta "Well? Are you taking him or not? You need to work on communicating with people. I learned not too long ago that being straightforward is the best way to get things done. I don't see why you people all need to beat around the bush..."
    hagami "I-I..."
    hagami "Come on."
    "She takes my arm again."
    kenta "Then you are going. Feel better, Takeru."
    "I look back at him, but for some reason I can't bring myself to even wave. I'm terrified of speaking. I'm sure I've already made a fool of myself, but I just don't want to do worse."
    "Once again I feel disconnected. But this time it doesn't scare me. I just want this to be over, and so if I autopilot through it, fine, that's easier."
    
    "What follows plays out without any control from me. I might as well be living through a recording, where the outcome is predetermined and the real me is just watching from a corner."
    "We're in the nurse's office at this point."
    "I answer a few questions about my medical history, but they already have my information on file."
    "Then they start asking my name, the day of the week. They ask Hagami's name as well."
    hagami "..."
    "I catch a glimpse of her sitting in a chair by the front door. Waiting? Presumably she has class."
    "But when I look at her, she flinches. I try to talk to her without actually making a sound."
    takeru "...I'm sorry."
    "She just responds with a sigh."
    "I'm drawn into another curtained room."
    "At some point Dr. Meadow is on the phone, from the clinic. He has questions as well, although I don't really notice who answers them."
    "Someone offers me pills. I don't refuse. There's not a whole lot they could do to make things worse at this point."
    "There's about a half hour wait. The curtain is drawn around my room at the nurse, and I can't do much but sit with my elbows on my knees and wonder what comes next."
    "Meadow is on the phone again."
    meadow "Takeru? It's good to talk to you again."
    "You too."
    meadow "How are you feeling?"
    "Fine. Not really, but good enough."
    meadow "We have an open appointment on Thursday we can probably see you in, although if you'd like to come earlier..."
    meadow "I can contact your parents and see if..."
    "Fine. Sounds good. Don't bother. See you then."
    meadow "As for today..."
    "I really just want to get back to my room."
    meadow "I'm sure the staff at Mirako has things covered. Hope the rest of your day goes better, Takeru."
    "I appreciate your optimism, doctor."
    
    "Finally I seem to be on my way out. And hopefully back to my room where I can hide and try to figure out where to go from here."
    "It's still too early in the day for anybody to be headed home, but, at some point, Kenta showed up. I get the feeling Hagami never really left."
    kenta "...No, it's fine, I'll go with him. I'm his roommate after all."
    hagami "And... classes?"
    kenta "I hate to do it. It's painful for me. But he is my roommate after all."
    hagami "And before?"
    kenta "I said roommate, not nursemate. And he's going back to the dorm room, right? I'm not his nursemate. What a ridiculous concept."
    "While half of me wants to shut up and let them work out whatever's going on, I've already been enough of a pain on everyone today."
    takeru "I'm fine, Kenta. I can get back myself."
    kenta "Are you sure? You were very strange at lunchtime. Even stranger than normal."
    takeru "Look, don't miss class because of me. It's a short walk back to the dorms so it's not like I'm going to go walk into traffic or something."
    "Kenta checks his watch twice in a row. I can only imagine his internal struggle."
    kenta "This is my fault. I should've woken you up on time. Please forgive me."
    takeru "I honestly don't care. Kenta, just go to class."
    kenta "You're a gentleman, Takeru. Goodbye."
    "He bows and runs off."
    "Next to me, Hagami's shoulders slacken a bit, but she still seems on guard."
    takeru "Told you he was my roommate. I'm not sure where ke kept coming from today..."
    hagami "I found him."
    takeru "You..."
    takeru "Thanks, Hagami, but... Same thing goes for you. Just get to class. I don't need to drag anyone else through this with me."
    hagami "..."
    takeru "Follow Kenta's example. Go on."
    "She jumps a but but doesn't move."
    hagami "The nurse said..."
    hagami "And I don't mind."
    takeru "I'm not a lost dog. I can - "
    takeru "You're not going anywhere, are you?"
    hagami "The faster we get going, then... the faster I get back."
    "I would've never expected her to be so stubborn. Especially when it looks like that this is about the last place she'd like to be right now."
    takeru "I get it. Come on."
    "We walk out through Mirako's gate, side by side."
    "Of course she doesn't say anything else. If I want company all I have are my own intrusive thoughts."
    "There's no point trying to piece together any of today's series of disasters right now. Questioning Hagami just seems painful, especially when I have no clue what she did or what actually happened. But even so, I feel like I have to say something."
    takeru "Hagami?"
    hagami "...?"
    takeru "Thank you."

label day10:

    "I'm up almost before the sun."
    "Last night I set the alarm for almost an hour earlier than normal, but I'm awake even before that. Guess a little paranoia never hurt."
    "In that aftermath of yesterday's disaster there are a few things I want to get done this morning."
    "That box with all my Tohoku memorabilia is still out in the open. I'm tempted to burn it or else dig a hole and bury it out back, but I settle for wrapping the whole thing in duct take and shoving it back in the cabinet. Lighting it on fire would probably wake Kenta up."
    "It can't be healthy wondering what's inside those letters from Meiko. I can imagine. I'm pretty sure I did imagine yesterday."
    "But isn't this running away? Would finally reading them get me to stop worrying about them for once? No. No of course not. That's what the duct tape's for."
    "With that taken care of, I'm almost ready to go, when, of course, Kenta stumbles out of bed, punctuating his speech with yawns."
    kenta "Good... Good morning, Takeru."
    takeru "Yeah, good morning. I was about to leave a note, but I'm headed to Mirako. See you."
    kenta "You... what? Did you take your - "
    takeru "It's been less than a day. Do you really think I'm going to forget that easily?"
    kenta "No, but, well, you did have a long phone call with that doctor yesterday, so, maybe something had changed."
    takeru "Same old stuff. They want me to go in to the clinic for a few days for observation, but, I think I'm doing alright here. I just can't forget again."
    "To be honest though, I'm playing it down. Dr. Meadow wanted me back for a \"few weeks\" and the call was only that long because the last thing I want to do is have to start back at Mirako all over again. Instead, I'll fix this myself."
    "Which is why I need to leave early."
    takeru "See you later then, Kenta."
    kenta "Have... Have a good morning."
    
    "It's cooler than I'd like on the road up to Mirako. Cool enough where I should probably invest in a coat, because I'm pretty sure I just sealed my only overcoat (maroon with the Tohoku seal) into a cardboard box."
    "When I get to the Mirako gate, I miss a step and almost fall over."
    "I regain my balance and hesitate, looking up at Mirako's glass windows shimmering in the rising sun."
    "Idiotic. Why am I hesitating now? I worked out a plan last night, I knew how to fix this, and now I'm stuck before I even set a foot in the doors."
    "Dr. Meadow's recommendation was that I stay in my room today, then come in for observation tomorrow, and we'd reconsider Mirako next semester because somewhere someone had underestimated the extent of my illness."
    "Remembering the circumstances of my first admission, I really don't see how any could've \"underestimated\" it. This was nowhere near as bad as that first time and I'll be damned if I just run away from all of it again."
    "I took my pills today, so things should be fine. Just start walking again, get through that gate, get through that door, and go find -"
    hikari "Takeru. A little early isn't it?"
    "...Hikari."
    takeru "H-hello Hikari. You're..."
    hikari "You didn't expect to see me?"
    takeru "No, not really. I was just going to find you. I thought you'd be, well..."
    hikari "In an abandoned tea room somewhere, sulking?"
    takeru "Basically."
    "I'll leave out that I had no idea if she'd be pleased to see me or not. Yesterday... Maybe it was just me, but when she appeared in class she was nothing but pure malice."
    "The Hikari next to me doesn't seem concerned about that. She seems more concerned about me."
    hikari "I've been trying to push things. I never really knew what I could, or what I couldn't do. There never seemed to be a point to wandering around, so I stuck to where I was comfortable."
    hikari "Do you always come before classes and just stand here?"
    takeru "...No."
    hikari "Then why - "
    takeru "Yesterday was a bit interesting. Alright, it was a disaster, so I'm trying to..."
    hikari "Waiting here doesn't exactly solve anything does it? Let's get some tea. I'm interested to hear about it."
    takeru "Thanks. Okay, you're right."
    "I follow her down the pathway and into Mirako proper."
    "With nobody in the halls, we head for the old wing."
    takeru "This sounds like a stupid question, and it's been bothering me, but..."
    hikari "If it's bothering you, it's by definition important."
    takeru "Did we talk at all yesterday?"
    hikari "No."
    takeru "Really?"
    hikari "I went to your class in the afternoon to try and find you, but no luck."
    takeru "You're telling the truth?"
    hikari "The truth as I know it. Memory can be a funny thing."
    takeru "..."
    "We arrive at the tea room. I don't bother trying to figure out the implications of what Hikari's trying to say, and instead just concentrate on making tea."
    hikari "Why don't you try explaining exactly what happened?"
    takeru "I lost it. Remember I said I felt like some edges didn't quite match up? Like people forgetting who you were, saying they'd never met you."
    hikari "...I remember."
    takeru "It was sort of like that, but everywhere. I forgot to take my pills, and then..."
    takeru "Do you know shizophrenia?"
    hikari "In an abstract way. The details..."
    takeru "Well, somewhere, what I saw happening stopped being at all related to what was actually happening."
    takeru "I... saw you in class. And at lunch."
    hikari "I was never there. My own memory's been losing its... Well, that's not the relevant. No, I definitely wasn't there."
    takeru "...And probably I didn't see you at lunch, either."
    hikari "No."
    takeru "..."
    hikari "You're seeing me know, if that's what you're wondering. I'm really here. You didn't just invent me out of nothing."
    takeru "Right. Okay. There's a ton happening, but here's a place to start."
    takeru "I told you about Meiko? How I let her down?"
    hikari "I heard the basics."
    takeru "I was totally wrong about her."
    "Hikari has both hands out over her cup of tea. I wonder if that actually warms her up? Nevertheless, she's hanging on every word, so I might as well take this opportunity to put everything together."
    takeru "She never really forgave me."
    hikari "...What?"
    takeru "She said... it was an act, mostly. She just wanted to prove she didn't need me, so she was acting all gracious and composed. I think she still hates me."
    takeru "Guess she just wanted to show she could shrug people off as easily as I could back then."
    hikari "I don't believe it."
    takeru "That's what she - "
    "But Hikari doesn't seem to be in disbelief, just upset."
    hikari "Not Meiko. No."
    takeru "You know her? Or... knew her, I guess?"
    hikari "Yes, but... I haven't seen in her in almost a year now. I think you're wrong about her, but, it's not important. Keep going."
    takeru "I hadn't talked to Meiko since she came out with that, and then..."
    takeru "It must not have actually happened, but I heard her... It wasn't an accusation, but, more..."
    takeru "More terrible. It couldn't have been real. I don't know where that voice came from. She told me I'm a coward because I keep running away from remotely unpleasant without worrying about what it'll do to other people."
    takeru "Whether it was her or not, it was pretty spot on."
    hikari "Not really."
    hikari "You're here, talking to me, a person who probably couldn't be called a person any more, even after you found that out. You're still at Mirako, even after what sounds like a nightmare yesterday."
    takeru "I up and left Meiko once. No idea how I'm supposed to talk to her now... And after things went wrong at Tohoku I escaped out to Mirako."
    takeru "And I don't even know why I why I'm here talking to you. I guess I'm just trying to figure out if I hurt anyone. If that happened again I'd probably prove Meiko right and go back to the clinic."
    takeru "I don't want that happening again. Ever."
    hikari "Takeru..."
    hikari "You never did tell me what happened at Tohoku."
    takeru "It's..."
    "In a moment I'll probably be lying to her, so I try to avoid looking her in the eye."
    hikari "I know you're hiding it. Or at least avoiding it. I think... if you brought everything in the open, it might help."
    takeru "It's not a very pleasant story. And I end up looking worse than dirt."
    hikari "I don't judge. You can trust me."
    "I remember that hand she held out, the hand I tried to grasp but couldn't. She trusted me then, that I wouldn't run away screaming."
    "Right. I'll try it, Hikari."
    takeru "I think it wasn't even a month into my second season, er, second year at Tohoku High. I hadn't been feeling great for a while but I put it down to nerves. I never really got nervous before, but..."
    takeru "I was supposed to be the top of the rotation pitcher for one of the top national teams. So when little details didn't add up, or I heard the wrong person say something, or it turned out nobody said it... I thought it was just stress or something."
    "Hikari nods. I figure she can relate."
    takeru "The team captain, Yoshida, was probably the only guy with a bigger profile than me, but that's mostly because he was mean as hell. We let him get away with pushing us around because, well, we won games, and he usually saved the worst of it for the other team."
    takeru "It must've been Sunday practice, but I was pitching to him. We had an argument, and er, the specifics aren't important I guess..."
    hikari "I don't mind."
    takeru "No, really, they aren't. I don't even remember. From what I saw, he called time. Walked out of the batter's box. Then he sort of... called for the ball? For me throw it to him?"
    takeru "I'm told that didn't happen."
    "Hikari still has her attention focused on the cup of tea. When I don't continue, she looks up, but doesn't interrupt."
    takeru "I hit him with a fastball in the jaw, broke it in two places."
    takeru "I don't know what happened to him after that. I doubt he ever came back that season."
    takeru "Everyone was livid, they thought I'd just hit him because of some dumb argument. They all thought I was just lying. So they dragged a sports psychologist in, then the real psychologist, then a psychiatrist, then a psychologist again..."
    takeru "So now I'm here at Mirako. And I never want to touch a baseball again, let alone get into this weird... state. People just wind up hurt and I don't even recognize it."
    hikari "Physically, or...?"
    takeru "No one's giving me a driver's license or issuing permits to operate heavy machinery to an idiot like me, so at this point I'm less worried about physically injuring anyone..."
    takeru "But Meiko proved her point. I don't need help from a mental illness to injure people."
    hikari "Thanks for explaining."
    takeru "Thank you for listening to my stupid story where I break my captain's jaw and then shoot my career in the foot before it ever begins. You can feel free to leave now."
    hikari "At least appreciate it when I'm trying to be sincere. I'm not going anywhere. You understand you're my only real link to Mirako now, right? Stories like that are all I've got."
    takeru "...I guess. It's a lousy story."
    hikari "It's the human condition. All stories are lousy."
    takeru "I don't need to hear anything from you about the 'human condition.'"
    hikari "Very funny."
    takeru "Look, I get this is just a spectator sport for you but I'm trying to figure out what exactly I screwed up yesterday and how to fix it."
    hikari "Then, to start..."
    hikari "I think you're wrong about Meiko."
    takeru "How? About what?"
    "Hikari closes her eyes for a few moments."
    hikari "She's not a malicious person. She could never carry a grudge for years and then... She can't hold it against you now, no way. She's more fiery than she looks on the surface, but..."
    takeru "None of that happened with Meiko yesterday, right, but on Sunday she was pretty clear."
    hikari "Then she's..."
    hikari "I didn't want Meiko to have changed. Maybe what happened last year cut deeper than I thought."
    "Hikari looks like she's concentrating, but she doesn't speak. Finally she lets out a forlorn sigh."
    takeru "You really did know her, didn't you?"
    hikari "...Don't classes start soon?"
    takeru "Er, right, I almost lost track of time. Thanks for hearing me out and not up and leaving on me."
    "...and don't think I didn't notice that change of subject."
    hikari "I hope you can work things out, Takeru. I don't think it's all as bad as you think it is."
    hikari "Look out for Meiko if you can."
    takeru "It's a bit late, but I'll do my best."
    "Hikari stands in the doorway of the tearoom as I leave."
    "She watches after me, but doesn't return my goodbye. There's that same look of frustration on her face."
    "Yoshida's injury and my humiliating departure from Tohoku aren't exactly things I like to dwell on, but looks like something equally painful came up for her."
    "I wish I could take the time to figure it out, but I have my own agenda to get through today. I head for homeroom."
    
    "It's later than I thought actually. I take my seat next to Natsumi as Meiko wraps up her talk."
    meiko "...So I know even with the festival coming up a few days, please pay attention to um..."
    meiko "Please pay attention to classes. But if you have any paperwork you should come see me, and I can help get it in. But as a class we should, ehm..."
    natsumi "Psst. Heya Takeru."
    takeru "What do you want?"
    natsumi "Rude. You're getting very impolite these days. I'm a very dignified person you know, so - "
    takeru "Is it just me or is Meiko kind of talking in circles?"
    natsumi "Huh? I don't usually pay much attention, but... I guess? Maybe she's run out of material."
    takeru "This isn't exactly a standup routine."
    natsumi "Whatever."
    natsumi "Hey! I almost forgot because you vanished yesterday, but I've got a deal for you. And it's time limited too. The tournament starts Friday."
    takeru "Declined."
    natsumi "You'll be intersted! I swear. So don't even think about running away at lunch."
    "I slump over in my desk. Kill me now.  At least it doesn't look I bungled things too horribly with Natsumi yesterday if she's still on about her baseball tournament plans."
    takeru "Hey Natsumi..."
    natsumi "What's up?"
    takeru "You didn't see Hikari in class yesterday, did you?"
    natsumi "Who?"
    takeru "White-haired girl that fumbled that physics question on Friday."
    natsumi "Who did what now?"
    takeru "Good. Thanks. That's all I need to know."
    natsumi "I feel like I'm being tricked."
    takeru "See how you like it for once."
    "I go back to pretending to be dead as classes start in earnest. I'd forgotten I'm going to have to make up work for the classes I missed yesterday, as if I wasn't already far enough behind after missing a few months while I was in the clinic."
    "And of course there's going to be teachers that want explanations, and I'll be absent again tomorrow to head to the clinic..."
    "Ugh. The only bright spot on the horizon at this point is the cultural festival. Let's hope Mirako's is as fun as it's been hyped up to be because I could certainly use a distraction."
    
    "True to her word, not a moment after the bell, Natsumi is standing over my desk."
    "I wonder if there would be any consequences if I just up and left. But I remember it's like Hikari said: it's not as terrible as I think. I'll tell Natsumi to get lost and this will all be over with the tournament in a couple days."
    natsumi "Hey, if it isn't - "
    takeru "You don't have to beat around the bush, Natsumi."
    natsumi "Well I thought I'd been pretty direct so far, and that usually works, so..."
    natsumi "Ah whatever. So! I did my research?"
    takeru "Research? Please don't tell me this has to do with - "
    "She pulls out her Tohoku baseball yearbook."
    takeru "Yeah. That."
    natsumi "Takeru, I'm not dumb. I'm pretty good at reading people."
    "Yeah, just like you were so great at reading Hagami and reading my attitude towards this whole tournament thing."
    natsumi "I knew there was something - something! - that was your way. I didn't know if you couldn't join our team because of blackmail, injury, a feud, maybe a failed drug test, or what. But I was going to find out."
    takeru "Don't tell me you..."
    natsumi "I talked to this guy."
    "Natsumi has the stats book open to our second baseman. Decent guy. He graduated this year and I think pinch hits for a college team now."
    natsumi "One of my players knew his brother. Oh, and this guy too. One of the other pitchers hung out with after a tournament once and had his number."
    "She flips to a backup catcher. My year. An ex-friend."
    "This doesn't lead anywhere good."
    natsumi "I understand about the argument."
    takeru "Argument?"
    natsumi "With the captain. Whatever bad blood you had is gone now. I'll be your captain. Hell you could be my captain if you actually tried, with those stats. Point is, I won't hold that against you."
    takeru "There was no argument. That's not the - "
    natsumi "You don't get along with your coaches or captains. So you thought if you joined up with me, we wouldn't be on good terms any more. It's actually really flattering, Takeru. I'm glad you value our friendship above baseball."
    natsumi "That's fine. Let's be friendly rivals. See if you can take the captainship from me next year. Our team isn't even that competitive. We get along great. We have lunch together every day. I'd be absolutely honored if you..."
    natsumi "You're laughing at me."
    "I'm laughing because she's so absolutely off in the complete opposite direction it's funny."
    "All the stories she's probably hearing are that I hit Yoshida in retaliation for some grudge or out of jealousy or something like that. No one cares if I was seeing straight that day or not. I'm sure none of them had kind words for me."
    takeru "Not interested."
    natsumi "You can't be..."
    natsumi "Takeru, no one who puts up the numbers here on this page doesn't just think baseball's a game. It's a passion. I know you want to play, somewhere, so, help me out, and if I'm wrong..."
    "Somewhere in there my laughter turned weak. There's no good way to explain anything, and all I want know is to fast forward an hour, or a few days, to when I can wash my hands of Natsumi and her tournament problem for once and for all."
    natsumi "Well?"
    meiko "That's not the truth."
    takeru "Meiko?"
    "How long has she been listening?"
    meiko "They're covering for him."
    natsumi "Hey Meiko, guess you heard I figured out why Takeru won't - "
    natsumi "Hey, wait, hang on. What do you mean?"
    meiko "All those players you called up. There was never any argument. If you wanted to know you should've just asked me. I've known Takeru forever."
    "All I can do is watch. I feel like the train's about to run off the end of the tracks here. How much does Meiko know? What on earth is she trying to do?"
    natsumi "I mean you did have that copy of the roster. I should've known you're a stalker."
    meiko "Takeru was injured. After he tore a cuff in his shoulder he couldn't pitch for anything so they dropped his scholarship. That's it. You might as well give up."
    natsumi "Seriously? Takeru!"
    "Natsumi grabs me by the shoulders. I'm still too dumbstruck to do anything about it."
    natsumi "Don't lie about injuries! It's not something to be ashamed about. And all your teammates at Tohoku were going to back you up on this?"
    natsumi "The sports culture at all those top tier schools must be real screwed up. If you get hurt, that's a sacrifice for the game. Around here you wear your scars with pride."
    natsumi "Sorry if I was hounding you, but you should've just been honest to begin with. I don't think any less of you just because you tore your shoulder. That's just..."
    natsumi "Okay Takeru, I've got to get to lunch, but if you ever want to try out your left arm, or even just take batting practice with us, I wasn't lying that we're all friendly. Come with me now if you want."
    takeru "Er, that's alright."
    natsumi "Suit yourself. Tomorrow I want to hear some war stories from Tohoku though. Seeya!"
    "With Natsumi gone, I'm left with the stonyfaced Meiko. We both look at each other. More than anything I want to ask her what she was trying to accomplish. Is that seriously what she thinks? Is she trying to exact revenge by blowing what she thought was my cover?"
    "But... It did get Natsumi off my back."
    takeru "MEIKO..."
    meiko "Sorry, I've got a lunch meeting at the office today. Let's talk later."
    "She brushes back her hair and walks out, but she's noticeably less composed than usual. I'm left to stare after her, alone in the empty classroom."
    "One day, just for one day, I want to get a handle on what she's thinking. I've known her half my life know and I still can't figure her out."
    
    "I find the old library deserted. It's strange considering I spent a good chance of time trying to escape from Natsumi before even starting on my way up."
    "Turning on the light, it doesn't look much different. It remains a mystery how the pile of books on the table regrows every night to cover where I usually sit."
    "The radio sits there. Silent, thankully."
    takeru "Actually..."
    "Now's a good a chance as ever. That recording I heard yesterday... It couldn't actually exist, could it?"
    "I fumble with the radio controls, but no matter how many times I jam the eject button, nothing happens. How does this thing even work? Who builds a CD player to look like an antique radio?"
    "I'm just about shaking the thing in frustration when there's a voice at the door.\""
    hagami "Takeru...?"
    takeru "Oh, hey Hagami. I wasn't going to hurt the radio, I swear. Don't look at me like that. I was just trying to check the CD in it."
    "But that doesn't seem to be what she's concerned about."
    hagami "I thought you were... The clinic..."
    takeru "Er..."
    "I stop throttling the radio. I almost forgot Hagami got a full dose of my weirdness yesterday. And I think bailed me out as well?"
    takeru "Sorry about that. You knew about the schizophrenia, right... I wasn't thinking straight. I forgot my meds and things sort of went downhill."
    "She sits down without responding."
    takeru "Thanks for dragging me to the nurse. I'm sure I wasn't..."
    "Hagami looks away. What exactly was I doing yesterday?"
    takeru "Was I that bad?"
    hagami "You'd have done the same for me."
    takeru "I don't know, I can apparently be a pretty big idiot sometimes."
    hagami "All I did was return a favor."
    takeru "You mean with Kenta? That wasn't anything."
    hagami "...It was to me."
    takeru "Er... Thanks, then."
    "Hagami seems even more uncomfortable than usual. She's practically hiding behind her book again and not even touching her lunch. I had sort of hoped we were on better terms. I'm feeling out of place again."
    "Time to change the subject."
    takeru "Mana's still out?"
    hagami "Pneumonia."
    takeru "No kidding... She's going to be alright?"
    hagami "Hopefully. In a few days."
    takeru "Say hi from me then when you see her."
    "Hagami just nods."
    "Within a few minutes, that silence fills in again."
    "I look at the radio. Hagami obviously doesn't want to dwell on what happened yesterday, but I have to know."
    "While I'm trying to think how I'm going to ask about something so obviously crazy as a Hikari/Hagami/Meiko conspirancy to plant a voice CD, Hagami turns a dial, then a switch, and the radio bursts into static."
    "A woman's voice. I jump."
    "But as the moment of panic subsides, I realize the woman's someone much older, saying a few words about chamber music dedications before the music starts up. It's some string and piano piece again, not the greatest recording quality."
    "Hagami peers over the edge of her book, one eyebrow raised. I guess she noticed that that scared me."
    takeru "...Sorry. Is that the same CD as yesterday."
    hagami "Yes."
    takeru "And it's not Meiko. You don't know Meiko, right? Er, you didn't record her or anything?"
    "The single raised eyebrow turns to two."
    hagami "Meiko?"
    takeru "On the student council."
    hagami "Don't know here."
    "Hagami works her black magic and ejects the disc. She holds it up for my benefit, and, as expected, it's unlabelled. It looks like a home recording, identical to that CD I pulled off the shelf last week."
    takeru "Right. Of course not. It's not Meiko. That was just..."
    "Her voice, from nowhere. A voice in my head."
    takeru "Never mind. What are those discs anyway? I thought you were only into that weird German orchestra stuff."
    hagami "It's... When I... They..."
    "She rises and walks to the back of the library, then stands there for a solid thirty seconds."
    takeru "Hagami?"
    takeru "You don't have to answer, it was just curiosity."
    "But I realize she's searching through a stack of paper that was previously hiding behind a box of magazines. Actually... It looks like she's sorting through newspapers?"
    "Finally she returns with one. Tossing it down in front of me, she does her best to sink as low as possible behind the wall of a book she's put up on the table between us."
    takeru "'Showa College of Music - Weekly News?' I don't get."
    "It looks like a college newspaper, dated maybe twenty years ago. When Hagami doesn't respond, I start skimming headlines."
    "To call these headlines would be generous. It's more of a newsletter than newspaper."
    "Half of the page is notices about faculty and other junk, but in the center is a black and white photo of a couple, her at a piano and him seated with a string instrument. A cello?"
    "The lead story reads \"Showa's most well-known alumni return: Inori Keiji and Naomi to perform concert series.\" The rest is details about dates and times, plus a quick bio. Looks like they graduated the same year."
    takeru "Sorry, can't say I know either of them. I don't really know a whole lot about this sort of thing."
    takeru "Hey, wait, you're Inori Hagami right? Are these people related?"
    "I'm met with silence from behind the book, but if I tilt the photo, it's clear there's a family resemblence."
    takeru "That's neat. So they stopped by this college, and then performances in Tokyo, then in Russia, then off to the United States?"
    takeru "They must be pretty famous then. The chance of anyone ever amounting to anything in my family pretty much died with me, but you've got two parents worldhopping?"
    "Still no response."
    "I might as well drop it. Either I've missed something obvious or I screwed up yesterday more than I thought."
    "It does seem to make sense though that Hagami has an interest in old music recordings, but why would her parents' stuff be buried in the back?"
    "And she did seem to have a bit of an odd reaction when I dug out those old discs for the first time. Didn't she think it must've been Mana?"
    takeru "Hopefully Mana's feeling better soon."
    hagami "...Yeah."
    hagami "I should get to class. Need to be early today."
    takeru "Er... See you later then."
    "She flicks off the radio and walks out."
    "It's a good ten minutes before lunch ends. And I'm not sure I actually saw her eat anything anyway. A few days ago I thought we were actually talking like normal people?"
    "Mana better heal up. I'm sure she'd be able to explain this, or at least prevent me from doing anything too stupid."
    "Sitting alone in the old library is just depressing though. With a sigh I head for class."
    
    "Afternoon classes are subdued. I do my best to follow along to physics, but even Natsumi subdued, my concentration is flagging."
    "Meiko, a desk away, is stalwart as usual, even in the face of whatever monstrosity the teacher's chalking up at the front of the room."
    "She mentioned classes were taking their toll, but... It's hard to imagine. Her reputation is pretty much universal. I thought she was only in class out of formality and she knew all this stuff already."
    "Out of the corner of my eye, I spot another student doing their hardest to pay attention. Hikari?"
    "I have to check twice to make sure I'm not seeing things, but she was in class on Friday, after all. No reason to think I've started losing it again."
    "Hikari catches me looking and flashes a grin. Well, more a grimace, but close enough."
    "She doesn't try to answer any questions this time though. And by the time school's out for the day, I can't spot her. I'll put that down to her strange not-alive not-dead state. Not that that sounds like any more of a sane explanation."
    "Natsumi snaps me out of it."
    natsumi "See ya Meiko. Bye Takeru. Practice is all day today."
    meiko "Bye."
    natsumi "Oh, Takeru, once this whole tournament is settled, you're still welcome to show up to practice. I could use a good assistant and I'm sure you've got experience. Once you get over whatever Tohoku put you through, you know."
    takeru "I'll consider it. See you later."
    "I probably won't consider it, but at least I can hope she's given up for now."
    "However, that still leaves me with Meiko."
    "Even as everyone else filters out of the room, she's still standing there, shoulders straight, same as ever. She doesn't talk, or even look at me."
    "Probably Meiko's having just as much trouble finding words as I am."
    takeru "Hey."
    meiko "Hi Takeru. You're still here."
    takeru "It's not like I have anything important to do. You don't have a meeting or club activities or anything?"
    meiko "There might be one or two people at the front office expecting me..."
    "She waves her hand."
    meiko "They'll live."
    meiko "You disappeared yesterday after lunch. I hope it wasn't anything bad."
    takeru "I'm not sure what you heard, but, er, it wasn't great."
    meiko "Kenta filled me in on the basics. He said it was something to do with your..."
    takeru "Schizophrenia."
    meiko "Then you mean..."
    takeru "He wasn't wrong."
    takeru "You probably guessed I wasn't being completely straight with you that first day in the cafe. About just dropping out of Tohoku for poor performance or something."
    natsumi "I did guess. The average dropout doesn't choose Mirako as a backup school either."
    takeru "Right. And they don't drop after just an injury like a shoulder tear. There's surgery for that. I'm surprised Natsumi didn't jump on that one."
    meiko "It was a poor lie, maybe, but it did the trick. At least I hope it did. I'm sorry if I intruded."
    takeru "Er, no, I really appreciate it really, I just..."
    meiko "Didn't understand why?"
    takeru "Not really."
    "Meiko brushes back her hair and pauses a moment, finally decided to stand while I keep my seat on my desk."
    meiko "That Tohoku yearbook was mine. You knew that much. I'm at least partially responsible for sending her after you. I know how Natusmi can be."
    meiko "The other part of it was..."
    meiko "Sorry I don't know how sensitive you are about your..."
    takeru "Schizophrenia. It doesn't exactly look like it's going anywhere so I'd better get used to people talking about it."
    meiko "Kenta said you mentioned me."
    takeru "I probably did. I... heard you loud and clear, all day."
    meiko "We never even said hello yesterday."
    takeru "...I was afraid of that."
    meiko "Look, I know I put a lot on you on Sunday. I didn't mean to tell you half of that, at least not all at once. It felt great to get it off my chest, but if all I did was move that burden to you, to the point that the next day, you'd..."
    takeru "That wasn't the problem. Not the whole problem anyway. I forgot my pills, I was up all night doing... Well, don't feel like it's your fault. It's just me being defective."
    meiko "...This morning was just my silly attempt to patch things up, if I could. I'm afraid there was a bit too much to undo."
    takeru "Oh please, don't apologize, that's the best thing that's happened today by far. I should be thanking you."
    "She stiffens."
    takeru "Sorry. I know you said it makes you uncomfortable, but..."
    takeru "It works both ways, right? So it weirds me out to hear you apologize. That should be what I'm doing. We both know you're not in my debt. If I hadn't screwed things up years ago, you wouldn't be here now."
    takeru "I was terrified yesterday. Somehow I got it into my head that when you told me the truth on Sunday, that was your declaration of war. I'd never be able to dig myself out of that hole."
    meiko "It was more like a concession speech. I'm sick of..."
    "Meiko makes that motion of clearing the air in front of her. Whatever she's sick of is apparently too abstract."
    meiko "Alright. I think I understand a little better now."
    takeru "Good because I'm pretty much useless."
    takeru "If you needed to get to the office, don't feel obligated to hang around with me."
    meiko "It really isn't that important today, but..."
    "She turns to leave."
    meiko "And Takeru, don't blame yourself that I wound up here. It's as much my decisions that put me here as yours. And it's not some curse either. There have been enough unpleasant things, but..."
    meiko "I've got a long ways to go, but I've changed for the better. I'm sure you can too."
    meiko "See you."
    "I just nod as she vanishes."
    "She said as much before, but I still have trouble believing she's as shaken up about this whole atmosphere between us, whatever it is."
    "Dammit, I forgot to check if there was more festival work to do. It's the least I can do if I'm responsible for she's going through at the moment. I can try to make sure she comes out in one piece at the end. She'd do the same for me."
    
    "Those are my thoughts as I sit in the empty classroom."
    "Until I notice it's not empty. There are eyes on the back of my neck."
    takeru "Hikari? How long have you been there?"
    hikari "Oh not long."
    takeru "Don't be coy. You're looking mighty smug. Eavesdropping, I guess?"
    hikari "I was here long enough then."
    takeru "Guess I've found the real reason you keep sneaking into class..."
    hikari "It's true enough."
    "She cross the room to where I'm still sitting on my desk. Maybe it's just something I never noticed after seeing her in that tearoom for so long, but in the windowed sunlight, she looks less substantial. Downright fragile."
    takeru "I hope you enjoyed that thoroughly confusing conversation with Meiko. It was probably pretty boring to boot."
    hikari "I thought it was kind of nice. And I told you this morning, didn't I? Meiko won't hold a grudge."
    takeru "I'm not completely sold. Did you really come just to get the details on Meiko? Checking in on all your friends?"
    hikari "Yes... Yes and no. It's strange to see all these people after they've forgotten about me. I realized I forgot parts of them. Just bits and pieces, but those little jagged edges are what give people their character."
    takeru "I could do without the edges."
    hikari "Takeru the baseball star is boring. Meiko the model student is boring. If all you can remember about someone is a generalization, you've already forgotten them."
    hikari "I needed to make sure I hadn't forgotten who Meiko was."
    takeru "Right."
    takeru "Don't tell me it was me this morning that made you think you had. I was pretty bad off yesterday so I wouldn't trust any of what..."
    hikari "That's the problem. That's the other reason I came here. I needed to find you."
    takeru "Oh yeah?"
    hikari "This morning, I know we met..."
    hikari "It's already foggy though. Like something that happened months ago. You told me about Tohoku, and Yoshida, and Meiko, and..."
    hikari "I thought my sense of time was off, but then it turns out it's memory."
    takeru "You forgot you saw me today?"
    hikari "No, I know that, I know the big picture, but the details..."
    hikari "I'm slipping."
    takeru "What?"
    hiakri "You even saw it once, at the tearoom. It's as if I blink I've lost something. Sand through my fingers. Just a grain, but I feel it."
    takeru "You still knew Meiko, though, right? Just be glad you don't have entire days you have to put together afterwards."
    hikari "You don't get it."
    takeru "Er, I get why you're worried, but - "
    "Hikari paces."
    hikari "This is what I've been saying. It is the tiny things that count. That gut feeling I had that if Meiko dropped her calm, she'd already forgiven you. The surprise when you finally tricked me at chess for once."
    hikari "All the ticks that went into that conversion just now that you called confusing and boring. Those are important."
    hikari "Something might happen in the third act. The payoff. Fireworks. Those are all pointless without the rocky steps on the way."
    hikari "There aren't any fireworks at the end for me any more. I'll just fade off. The bumps and daily drama are all I get. So understand why I'm frustrated I'm losing the details. They're all I've got."
    "Hikari goes quiet for a second, but she doesn't look spent. I don't interrupt."
    hikari "That probably sounded very bitter."
    takeru "Er, maybe, but I'm sorry if I sounded like I didn't think it mattered. I guess I didn't get it."
    hikari "I should probably stop belittling you if I want your help."
    takeru "My help? I'm not really sure what I can do. I'm not a..."
    "I try to think of who Hikari might need to help her but I draw a blank."
    takeru "I'm not some ghost mediator. Maybe you need a pyschic. Or a priest, maybe."
    hikari "Are you sure you're not a priest? You pulled a very good impression a week ago."
    takeru "Oh come on, don't bring up the ghost hunt. I thought you were supposed to be nice if you wanted my help. I got conned into that whole thing. If you want to blame someone for that, blame..."
    "Hagami?"
    "That... That is probably who I would talk to. If I had some bizarre not-quite-defined problem with someone not-quite natural..."
    "I would consult someone who's not-quite joking about the not-quite natural."
    takeru "...at least I don't think she's joking? Right? Maybe..."
    hikari "What are you muttering about?"
    takeru "Shinto prayer to boost your long term memory."
    hikari "I was wrong when I said you were priestly. You really have no tact."
    takeru "Sorry."
    "But Hikari's smiling all the same."
    takeru "I can ask around. I might know a few people that have an idea what's going on."
    hikari "If I don't really understand the problem, or understand what exactly I am in the first place, there's probably not a lot out there..."
    takeru "You'd be surprised how much literature there is out there on anything close to a ghost. A whole library full."
    hikari "I'll trust your instincts then, Takeru. I guess I really don't have anyone else to count on."
    "She frowns at me."
    hikari "Your contact better not be that pink-haired girl who was going around with candles. She needs to learn to respect other peoples' belongings, and if she has the nerve to call me - "
    takeru "It's not her, promise."
    "Well, we'll see. I don't think Hagami's going to be very helpful if I'm back to being unable to carry out a normal conversation with her, let alone one about the details of ghosthood. Mana may be necessary."
    takeru "I'll do my best."
    hikari "Thank you, Takeru. Of all the people that could've chanced into remembering me..."
    hikari "I could do worse."
    takeru "Yeah. See you too."

label day11:

    "Tuesday morning."
    "Early Tuesday morning."
    "I was on the last train last night, and by the time I finally got back to the dorms, it was past midnight. So I don't appreciate waking up half an hour before my alarm."
    "Still, I'd rather be sleeping here than anywhere near that clinic. Hours of casual \"chats\" with Meadow and some other shrinks, trying not to mention Hikari..."
    "That I weaseled out of an extended stay is nothing less than a miracle."
    "Trying to to fall asleep again is probably pointless. Mustering the energy to rise, I start unpacking my bag. I was too exhausted to do anything last night."
    "Clothes I put in the hamper. Let Kenta figure out where to sort them."
    "My physics textbook goes on my desk. I really should've brought something more entertaining to read, because at this point even a recommendation from Hagami sounds more appealing."
    "Two new medicine bottles go on a shelf in the bathroom. I also have a checklist to go with them, an emergency medical card, and orders from Dr. Meadow to call immediately if anything happens again."
    "Nothing will. Not if I can help it. I take my meds and head back to the room, but..."
    "Somehow I missed it last night."
    "It must be an industrial-sized cylinder of bubble wrap. The bundle's as tall as the ceiling. At first I have the irrational urge to knock it over, then a creeping fear sets in..."
    "What does it mean that this is in my room?"
    "I look over to Kenta, still asleep."
    "Then, in the other corner, I see cardboard. Cardboard boxes? Hundreds of boxes, again piled to the ceiling."
    takeru "Kenta... Please no, Kenta."
    kenta "What... Huh? Good morning Takeru."
    takeru "I'm scared, Kenta. Why are there - "
    kenta "Good morning, Takeru."
    "I roll my eyes and return the greeting as he yawns."
    takeru "Good morning, Kenta."
    kenta "You're back."
    takeru "Yes, yes, I am. So what's with the boxes?"
    kenta "Oh, you missed most of the excitement."
    takeru "I'm sure there's plenty of excitement left. Is this a new hobby? Assembling cardboard boxes? Stuffing them with bubble wrap? I've never knew there was such a thing as a small parcel enthusiast."
    kenta "What are you talking about? They're just boxes."
    kenta "It's time to say goodbye to the insects. So I obviously needed a way to ship them. I wish you were here yesterday when I had to roll that bubble wrap in here."
    takeru "Okay, first, you didn't actually have to roll it in here and park it behind my bed. Second, aren't your bugs already in those display cases?"
    kenta "It was a flash sale. I auctioned them all off on a website for collectors. It's much more profitable to sell insect collections way then to sell in bulk."
    takeru "You... You sold them individually. Hundreds of bugs. To hundreds of different people. Online."
    kenta "Yes, that's what I said. Was anything unclear? I didn't think it was that hard to understand."
    "I'm having nightmarish visions of the bug processing operation that will no doubt end up be happening right here, in this room. Probably with my bed as the bug dissection staging area."
    kenta "You look interested. If you want you're welcome to join me packaging them."
    takeru "I'm not interested, I'm terrified."
    kenta "Is that close enough?"
    takeru "No!"
    kenta "Well I'll be starting right after classes end if you change your mind."
    "Looks like my mind's been made for me. I have to live here too, Kenta."
    takeru "Fine. I'll be there. Let's just get to Mirako so I can forget about this."
    kenta "Oh, you're right. I'm five minutes behind. You sure can waste time in the morning."
    "I sigh turn back to the big roll of bubble wrap. Now I'm more tempted to kick it over and collapse on top of it. Welcome back to Mirako."
    
    "Despite Kenta's complaints, we're on the road in plenty of time."
    "It's nice to be back. The clinic is by Tohoku, in the city, nothing like the clear air I'd started to take for granted, and now realize I'd missed."
    kenta "Did everything go well on your trip?"
    takeru "About as good as you'd expect, really. Just a bunch of doctors. They decided I was underdosed, or overdosed, or something, and just threw out all my old meds and gave me a new set."
    kenta "But you're staying at Mirako?"
    takeru "Are you kidding? Yeah. I wasn't going to let them talk me out of that."
    takeru "...That would be awful, trying to find another school, this time of year. Moving twice in a year."
    kenta "Very awful. I'd need to train another roommmate."
    takeru "I'm not sure if I should be flattered or insulted."
    kenta "It doesn't matter all that much."
    "We keep chatting and finally arrive at the school gates."
    "There's another change: A banner now hangs between the gateposts."
    takeru "'Mirako High 40th annual cultural festival - Welcome!'"
    takeru "Isn't that a bit early?"
    kenta "The festival's Saturday, you know. That's only four days away."
    takeru "Er, right, but shouldn't they start setting up on Friday then?"
    kenta "That's right, you've never been to one of these... It's a big deal. They have to start preparing early or they'd never finish in time."
    takeru "Huh... Guess this is bigger deal than I thought."
    "I should've known with how Meiko was acting about it. I should really at some point check if she needs any more help. If I can work up the nerve."
    "Then someone grabs my shoulders."
    natsumi "Takeru! Welcome back. And Kenta too. Good morning, Kenta."
    kenta "Good morning, uh..."
    natsumi "Natsumi. It's Natsumi, you dope."
    kenta "Well good morning. I'd rather not be late talking to you, so goodbye."
    "Kenta heads off and leaves me to walk to homeroom with Natsumi."
    natsumi "I love that guy."
    takeru "I think he honestly doesn't know who you are."
    natsumi "Of course he knows who I am. Everyone at this school knows me. He's just a master of the long con. A practical joker."
    takeru "You're absolutely terrible with people. There's no way he's kidding around. If he's decided to send stinging insects to a hundred internet strangers just to screw with me, I swear..."
    natsumi "What are you even talking about?"
    takeru "Never mind."
    natsumi "Everyone's been acting weird lately. Must be the big countdown!"
    takeru "Right. Four days to the festival."
    natsumi "No, no, I mean the tournament. Regionals start tomorrow. We leave tomorrow!"
    natsumi "Although the festival's important too, I guess."
    takeru "You'll be back in time for Saturday?"
    natsumi "Hopefully not."
    takeru "You don't like the festival?"
    natsumi "Don't get me wrong, the festival's great. The fireworks are great. Although there won't even be fireworks this year..."
    natsumi "But the regional is a knockout tournament. If we keep winning, we'll make it to championships on Saturday."
    natsumi "And then once we win that, we'll be back in time to party here. We'll celebrate under the firworks."
    takeru "Er..."
    natsumi "I know, not this year... They're both fantasies. With Hiyama injured our pitching's gonna be rough, and we're not that competitive to begin with."
    natsumi "I can dream though."
    "That's another thing I never quite figured out from Meiko. No one seems to agree with her decision on this firworks thing. And no one knows that she's the one responsible."
    "Actually, speaking of Meiko, where is she? Natsumi and I sit down, but there's no pep talk from the class rep today. Meiko's desk is empty."
    takeru "Hey Natsumi, do you know if..."
    "The teacher enters and I don't get to finish my question. I gesture at the chair, but Natsumi just shrugs."
    "I'm sure she'll show up."
    "In the meantime, I've got to actually pay attention. I'm going to end up with a lot of work to make up."
    
    "Sometime before noon, Meiko sneaks in. Well, it's not exactly stealthy, she just waltzes in and takes her seat, and nobody bats an eye."
    "I'd try to ask her where she was, but Natsumi's slumped over half asleep between us, and I think Natsumi is about the last person I'd want passing messages between me and Meiko."
    "Oh well. I'll just find out at lunch."
    "And just like that, there's the bell. Natsumi sits bolt upright and pretends to start taking notes. Meanwhile Meiko's probably been here less than ten minutes and she's already out the door."
    "But she turns around."
    meiko "Takeru. Good to see you."
    takeru "Hi, you too. I wasn't really gone that long though."
    meiko "Sorry, things are really hectic. Everything's on fast forward for festival week."
    meiko "It's a bit of a disaster. There was a shipment this morning we shouldn't have gotten, and now the daily council meeting's in another fifteen minutes..."
    takeru "That sould at least give you time to sit down for a minute then, right?"
    meiko "I suppose."
    "Meiko sits back at her desk, but still has that rigid posture. Can't she ever relax?"
    meiko "I've got some news."
    takeru "Yeah?"
    meiko "The full floorplan is finalized tomorrow. We can still make changes to the schedule flier, but once we assign splots that schedule's done. I've done what I can, but..."
    takeru "What?"
    meiko "Your friend. Hagami, right? I have her penciled in for a half hour on Saturday but without a club registered, there's a whole review process for that kind of space, so..."
    meiko "So I guess I have to remove her and this, hm, spirit club?"
    takeru "Right. Right, okay..."
    "The way things look, I'm probably going to owe Hagami a favor. I need her help with Hikari, and if I can do something for her first, then maybe I'll look like less of a crazy person. She still seemed spooked after that whole incident with the voice on the radio."
    takeru "I think they have enough members, they just didn't hand in the paperwork. When does that have to be in."
    meiko "A week ago. Takeru, I hate being strict about this, but exceptions are painful. I'm trying really hard to put this together and all these loose ends keep floating off... Too many distractions."
    "Meiko leans forward and crosses her arms on the desk."
    meiko "I just want this over with."
    takeru "Hey, I really appreciate this. I'll get the papers to you tomorrow. Until then, what can I help with? If this application's a distraction, let me handle two others for you."
    meiko "Thanks, Takeru. I wish it was that easy..."
    takeru "No, I get it. Most of this stuff you can't just delegate. It's got to be you doing it."
    meiko "It's not even that. Have a little tact about this, everyone thinks I'm running this show on my own, all fine, no problems. When in you're my position, you can't sweat it."
    meiko "Some of it you can probably handle. Anyone could. But my pride is telling me that if I can't do it alone and I can't do it perfectly, then why am I in charge in the first place?"
    takeru "It's all over after Saturday, right?"
    meiko "Thankfully."
    meiko "Alright, can you deal with this bad shipment we got this morning? The last council president ordered the fireworks months ago, last school year, and nobody cancelled the order after, well..."
    meiko "Nobody cancelled it. We're getting billed for it and there's a crate and equipment sitting in the gym."
    meiko "Just get rid of it. Get us a refund if you can, but..."
    "Meiko shudders."
    meiko "I don't want them in the festival. Get all of it out of Mirako."
    takeru "Roger."
    meiko "Thank you again. It really is a bit of a situation."
    meiko "Alright. I'm in control. I've got this. Four days to go. I've got to be in the council meeting room in a few minutes, so I'll see you this afternoon."
    meiko "Bye Takeru."
    takeru "See you."
    
    "The old wing seems stranger than usual."
    "Is it the quiet? The rest of the school is almost buzzing."
    "When I arrive at the old library, it's just as silent. Oh well. Guess either no one's here, or Mana's still not better."
    "Sure enough, when I push open the door, the lights are out."
    "The table's still littered with hardcover books, ghost manga, and that one decades-old newsletter from the Showa College of Music."
    "It's been ten minutes now since the start of lunch. Is Hagami out too? While I was out, did they decide to pick some other meeting place to get rid of me for once and for all?"
    "Putting my paranoia aside, I start clearing a place on the table. A few serial novels I stack by volume, and I'd stack the hardcovers if I had the energy to actually lift them."
    "I'm not sure what to do with the newsletter though. It seems like an antique. Where was that box Hagami had this in?"
    "Easily enough, I find it in the back. Are these sorted at all? I'd feel bad messing up the order. Taking a few out to check, they all have varied dates, stretching ten or twenty years, but I notice they all have something in common."
    "Inori Naomi debuts new piano sonata..."
    "Showa alums Inori Keiji and Naomi to perform at anniversary celebration in the UK..."
    "Then..."
    "There's no Inori in the headlines on this one. On the side profile, though..."
    "Famed graduate Inori Naomi's daughter to attend Showa affiliate high school."
    "Sure enough, there's Hagami staring back at me from the inset photo. She's a few years younger, but that half smile's the same as ever."
    hagami "Takeru?"
    "I didn't even hear the door. I drop the papers into the box and push it into the corner, trying to stand in front of it."
    takeru "Hey Hagami. Good to see you again."
    hagami "Hey."
    "She sits down. Hopefully she didn't notice anything."
    "I join her."
    takeru "I was wondering where you were."
    hagami "Downstairs. I just came back up to see if you were back yet."
    takeru "Yep. I escaped the clinc, finally."
    takeru "What do you mean 'downstairs?'"
    "Hagami doesn't respond and instead arms herself with one of the larger books still on the table. I suppose the wall will be going up any second now."
    "Today's reading material is titled \"The Japanese Existential Phantom: A Case Study of Pragmatic Disambiguation.\" Sounds like someone crossed one of Mana's novels with a thesis in semiotics."
    "What I really need to do though, is figure out how to bring up Hikari without looking like I'm having another schizophrenia-induced episode. Easier said then done."
    "But to my surprise Hagami speaks up."
    hagami "Then you're staying at Mirako?"
    takeru "Yeah. I'm not going anywhere, for better or for worse."
    hagami "Sometimes they can be difficult. The doctors."
    takeru "Dr. Meadow's alright. Kind of condescending but I guess if he's talking to me I can't blame him."
    takeru "Although I guess you wouldn't be too torn up if I transferred and let you read here in peace."
    hagami "Hm... I've kind of gotten over it."
    takeru "Over it?"
    "Although she seems a little more of what I remember, before I flipped out about secret voice recordings in front of her. Her book's flat on the table today instead of propped in my face."
    hagami "You really don't..."
    hagami "You don't remember, do you?"
    takeru "I'm still confused. Sorry."
    hagami "That's alright."
    takeru "Never mind. I sort of had a question."
    hagami "...?"
    takeru "Let's say, if I were a ghost, and I, er..."
    takeru "Let's say I have a friend who's a ghost. Well not really a ghost, er, more like no one else can see them. Or remember them, I guess. And they died, I think. That is a ghost, right?"
    takeru "Whatever, okay, so my friend who is probably a ghost, sometimes they have a problem with memory. Er, their own memory. Everyone else has memory problems with them, but she, I mean they, keeps forgetting little stuff."
    takeru "She keeps saying everything's blurry, like it happened a long time ago, and there are blips where she doesn't remember anything."
    takeru "Er, is there... anything in the literature about that?"
    "Yeah mission failed, I sounded totally unhinged. Hagami's one eyebrow looks like it's about to pop off her head."
    "Instead of saying anything, she slowly rotates the book on the table and pushes it towards me."
    hagami "Next time you can just ask what I'm reading if you like."
    takeru "What? Oh. That's your idea of a joke."
    hagami "...You started it."
    takeru "I was serious. Er, I said it terribly, but I wasn't kidding around. Somewhere you must've read about the horrors of paranormal amnesia or something like that. Right?"
    "Hagami just keeps staring at me."
    hagami "Okay."
    hagami "How much do you remember? Last week. Monday. You had your..."
    takeru "Oh I remember what I saw happen, just what I saw didn't actually happen. It's kind of an ongoing problem."
    takeru "If you're wondering, no, I'm not in some dissociative state. I took my meds yesterday and I'm all sober. I'm trying to ask your help, here, and not seem crazy at the same time."
    hagami "Okay."
    hagami "You said something about ghosts last week, and I..."
    takeru "Ignore that. I didn't do anything too terrible, did I?"
    hagami "..."
    takeru "Right. Sorry, what did I - "
    hagami "I don't know anything about memory loss in the supernatural. You said this was for a friend?"
    takeru "Yeah. Actually, no, ignore that too, forget I said anything about a friend. The important part is the amnesia. The rest isn't important. Er, she is important, but..."
    takeru "I'm really trying not to sound like a lunatic."
    hagami "Just explain."
    hagami "...I believe you."
    "I'll trust Hagami then. If this backfires I'm not sure how I'll explain myself to Hikari."
    takeru "Her name's Hikari. Do you remember last year's festival?"
    hagami "No... I transferred."
    takeru "Right. Huh. Anyway, something happened last year, and now it's like nobody even remembers her. You'll probably forget about her as well. It's happened to everyone else so far. You probably think I'm nuts."
    hagami "..."
    hagami "I don't know."
    takeru "Either way, she needs help. She doesn't know what's going on with her forgetfulness, and my guess is it's not exactly natural. Seeing as how she's dead and all. Er, not dead, but..."
    hagami "..."
    hagami "Is there a punchline?"
    takeru "What? I'm not joking here."
    hagami "Good. If you were joking, I'd be unhappy."
    hagami "...I never considered any of this would be useful."
    takeru "The supernatural books? I honestly have no idea what you believe in or not, but Hikari's real, and she could use some help."
    hagami "I can try."
    takeru "Thanks Hagami. You're the best."
    "Her smile's weak, but it's there. I guess she's not over looking for literal ghosts after all."
    hagami "I'll do what I can. I guess.. I won't be all that busy anyways."
    takeru "Is this about your festival performance?"
    hagami "Performance?"
    "Hagami blushes in moments."
    takeru "Er, festival application or display or budget or whatever it was."
    hagami "You didn't look?"
    takeru "No. But I got an update from Meiko. We should still be able to pull this off."
    takeru "Hikari's joining the supernatural club."
    hagami "Hikari? Have I met... Oh."
    "Not that I've talked to Hikari about this. I'm sure she'll be willing to sign her name on the club registration form when she hears everyone here is working to help her out. At least she better be."
    takeru "Just in name only of course. I think that should work."
    hagami "That's three members."
    takeru "I'm formally joining the supernatural club. That should put us over the top. Even if joining involves robes, weird hazing rituals, whatever."
    mana "Takeru! You're back? And you're joining the club? That's amazing! I'm not sure which is better."
    mana "And you want to do the initiation rite as well? That's even better! I'm not sure when the next full moon is, but we've got enough incense left, and - "
    "At the worst possible moment, Mana bursts into the room. No sniffles, no coughing. Just an unbridled enthusiasm for making me embarass myself."
    takeru "Hi, Mana. I thought you were still out sick."
    mana "I was back yesterday. I just had to help the swim team with festival setup for most of lunch. I'm famished."
    "She seats herself (knocking over my neatly piled ghost novels) and gets out her lunch, only to continue talking."
    mana "Hagami said you were at the hospital? Are you alright?"
    takeru "Just the clinic. I'm fine now."
    mana "And what's been happening this week? I feel like I've missed a lot."
    takeru "Yeah, maybe..."
    "Specifically she missed my explanation of Hikari's unique condition. I'm not even sure I want to explain that to her. Didn't Hikari make that sour face when she thought of meeting Mana again?"
    "But something's going to have to give here, or else it's going to look like I decided to join up specifically for prancing under the full moon or whatever nightmare's in store for me."
    hagami "I want to register the club."
    mana "You mean with the student council? You think they'll have a problem with the initiation? We took out the blood from the - "
    hagami "No. We're fine. But that's why Takeru's joining."
    takeru "I got the form from Meiko right here. We should all just have to sign."
    mana "Okay. I'm fine with registering. That means we won't get kicked out of our room, right?"
    takeru "I doubt Meiko would pull something like that, but yes, no getting kicked out."
    mana "Cool! Then... who's the fourth member? It's four to a club, right?"
    takeru "Er..."
    "Take the lead Hagami. I have no idea how to handle this."
    "Hagami seems prepared. She lays her arms on the table and arches her fingers, looking like a fortuneteller... Or maybe an evil mastermind."
    hagami "Mana. Tomorrow night. Dusk. We meet here."
    mana "What's going on?"
    hagami "We will be holding a seance. A ghost will join our ranks."
    mana "No way..."
    mana "Hagami! You mean you're going back to..."
    hagami "You will address me as High Priestess Hagami."
    mana "Amazing! This is fantastic! You'll be there too, right Takeru? Or do we have to do the initiation first? Hmmm..."
    "Kill me now. I'm sure I'm doing a terrible job at hiding my look of dread. Clearly Hagami has betrayed me. When I turn to Hagami, she still has that faint, unperturbed smile."
    "Looks like this will be the price of her help."
    
    "As expected, classes are a mess today. I've gone from behind to hopelessly behind. Before the festival it looks like I'll have to hand in makeup work for pretty much every class."
    "Normally I'd bother Meiko to help me through some of the harder problems, but of course she'll be tied up all week. I'm on my own."
    "Plus I have my own festival task from Meiko to take care of. And now a midnight meeting of the supernatural club because Hagami has a twisted sense of humor."
    "With all that in mind I do my best to actually do my classwork. Although I keep an eye out for Hikari appearing in some empty desk, she never surfaces."
    "Finally, the last bell sounds."
    meiko "I've got to run, Takeru. They need to someone to oversee setup back by the field."
    meiko "What we talked about this morning... I can count on you, right?"
    takeru "Right. I'll head down to the gym."
    meiko "Thank you. I still hate relying on anyone to - "
    meiko "Never mind. Thanks. See you later."
    takeru "Bye."
    "Looks like Natsumi already ran off somewhere too. I want to find Hikari sometime today, but for now, I should probably figure out what to do about the fireworks shipment that wound up in the Mirako gym."
    "The gym itself is buzzing. Half of the room is separated into aisles and squares marked by strips of painter's tape on the floor, and in the center someone's left numbered pieces of paper. There are way more students than I expected who want to show off their art or club or whatever else."
    "The other half of the room is a collection of collapsable chairs, folded tents, and other material. I spot that grill I pushed all the way up here with Meiko. Guess gym class is cancelled this week."
    "I spot what I'm looking for pretty quickly. It's a wooden crate as opposed to all the cardboard boxes, and there's a clipboard on top."
    "The clipboard is an invoice from Fujiworks Pyrotechnics. There's no fireworks in the box, apparently, just a bunch of equipment for the launch site to set up beforehand."
    "Refunding the box would probably be pointless. The big item on the bill is to bring in one of their technicians to set the whole thing off. For some reason I had a picture in my head of Meiko wearing goggles and lighting the fuses herself."
    "Whatever. There's a number to call at the bottom. I grab the clipboard and find a phone."
    takeru "Is this Fujiworks? Yeah..."
    takeru "Let me find the order number..."
    takeru "No..."
    takeru "Wait, if you've already booked the time, then - "
    takeru "Er, I sort of get it. What if we..."
    "I hang up after twenty minutes of running around. It's a lost cause. Maybe someone in the student council can argue the case better than I can, but now my job is to get this stupid box out of the gym."
    "The pushcart that came with the grill is still handy, so I load up the box and start taking this to..."
    "I guess I might as well put it in the old wing. That'd where all the junk of Mirako seems to end up."
    "Compared to pusing equipment up that hill, this is easy. I pick a room at random (looks like the piano room) and put the box with some others in a corner."
    "Now just to tell Meiko I didn't manage to get her money back."
    
    "But on my way out of the old wing, there's a voice behind me."
    hikari "Leaving so soon?"
    takeru "Hi Hikari. I should've known you'd be lurking around here."
    hikari "You'd be surprised. It's not so quiet down here these days... Everyone's packing and unpacking things."
    takeru "Must be because of the festival prep. You should see what it's like in the gym."
    hikari "It's hard enough to hide down here. I'll stay around here, thanks."
    takeru "You're hiding? I thought you were observing or doing reconaissance work or something the way you kept popping up in class."
    hikari "That's on my terms. I'd rather not run into people I know."
    hikari "People I knew, I suppose. They're familiar faces, but more and more..."
    hikari "Did you talk to your friend? Hagami?"
    takeru "She didn't have any ideas, but she said she'll help. You better appreciate it, by the way. I'm paying a pretty hefty price."
    hikari "I'll pay you back by teaching you some Indian defenses. Then maybe you'll stop humiliating yourself in the first three turns every chess game."
    takeru "I kind of get the feeling I'm in for a lot of humiliation in the next couple days..."
    "We head back to the tearoom."
    "I notice a few of the boxes that were once on the shelf are now on the floor and vice versa. They must be pulling out all the stops for the festival to remember that this room exists."
    "Hikari sits down. The chessboard is out, not unsurprisingly, but there's a few more pieces than usual dotting the board."
    takeru "Where'd this thing come from? Is this a bishop I guess? From some other set?"
    hikari "We needed a replacement knight for that thimble and I was bored enough to try carving another one."
    takeru "There's a lot more than a knight here."
    hikari "...I might've been very bored. I'm trying for a more traditional set than the Russian sort of one, but usually when you make round pieces, you use a lathe. So these ones are going to be octagonal."
    takeru "And you carved all this?"
    hikari "Yes?"
    takeru "...Yet you can't drink tea. Or move your own chess pieces."
    "Hikari tries for a few moments to pick up the stray pieces. Every once in a while she seems accutely uncoordinated. This is one of those times. Or is it just... impossible for her to touch them."
    "She gives up."
    hikari "Maybe that's another thing to ask Hagami. I suppose if other ghosts are allowed to throw knives and bang pots and pans together, I'm allowed to carve some pawns once in a while."
    takeru "Fair enough. Then can you find a pen and sign this?"
    hikari "Sign what?"
    "I draw out the club registration form."
    hikari "'Mirako High student group application...'"
    hikari "..."
    hikari "Takeru."
    takeru "Hagami needs it. It's what her help is going to cost us."
    hikari "Takeru, you're trying to get me to join something called the Mirako Ghosthunters Union."
    "I take the form back. Sure enough, there's the title at the top, in Mana's curly handwriting. Mirako Ghosthunters Union and Supernatural Society."
    takeru "Right..."
    hikari "Is irony completely dead to you?"
    takeru "The other members are interesting people. With, er, very interesting ideas of what's a good name for a club. I swear there's no ghosthunting, they mostly just listen to ancient chamber music and read terrible books. I'm not - "
    hikari "This would explain the robes and incense..."
    takeru "That was a fluke. I was straight up tricked. That isn't - "
    hikari "Are you going to ambush me and try to trap me in a jar or something? Maybe a vacuum cleaner?"
    takeru "What? No. Hikari if I was part of a club trying to hunt down the supernatural, I wouldn't be recruiting you into it. And besides, I don't think Mana actually cares about ghosts unless they can be her ghost boyfriend, so you should be safe."
    hikari "This is not encouraging."
    takeru "You don't even have to show up. We just need four members so Hagami can book a spot at the festival."
    hikari "And your brilliant plan was to have me sign on? Even if I'm still on the student roster, my name's going to raise some eyebrows, you know."
    takeru "I wonder about that."
    takeru "No one's seemed to really react when I mention you by name. There aren't too many Hikaris around either."
    takeru "Now that I think of it, the only one that ever noticed was Meiko."
    hikari "And how did she..."
    "When Hikari pauses, I look up. But she's vanished."
    "Where she was sitting across from me... No one. She was just there. She must've been..."
    takeru "Hikari?"
    hikari "What? It's your move, isn't it?"
    "When I look back across the table, there she is. Standing, not sitting, and talking like nothing even happened."
    takeru "Hikari..."
    takeru "Maybe I'm seeing things again."
    "Hikari takes a seat in her usual uneven motion, then the paper in front of her catches her attention. It's the club registration. She starts reading it. Rereading it?"
    hikari "Of course."
    hikari "This..."
    hikari "You were asking if I'd join your friend's club, weren't you?"
    "The humor is drained from her voice now."
    takeru "Yeah. You sort of..."
    hikari "I nodded off. I missed a step."
    hikari "I can't deal with this, Takeru. I'll put my info on the form. If they treat it like you tried to forge a fake student, I wouldn't be surprised. But I'll help out Hagami. I want this solved."
    takeru "You can count on her."
    hikari "You should introduce me."
    takeru "Er, when it comes to Hagami, Mana's usually around, but I don't see why not. You could come to lunch tomorrow, up in the old library."
    takeru "Actually... I've heard they'll be busy tomorrow, so maybe the day after."
    "Actually, I've heard they'll be setting up for a seance or an initiation or whatever hell show Hagami's planning to put on for Mana's benefit. Best sort this out with them first."
    hikari "I'll have this ready tomorrow, then."
    takeru "Thanks."
    hikari "Now wasn't I supposed to be teaching you some openings?"
    takeru "I might not be a very good student. There's a lot going on the next couple days."
    hikari "I could use a distraction. Maybe you could too."
    takeru "Right. I'll set up the board."
    takeru "...Is this the replacement knight?"
    "I'm holding a plain wooden figure, narrow, with a carved cylindrical head. Without paint it's hard to recognize as a knight."
    hikari "It's not quite right, I know. I'll paint it later and that should help."
    hikari "Some things are just irreplaceable."
    takeru "If you say so."
    "Hikari sounds oddly pensive about a chess piece, but I guess she's always been moody anyway."
    "Time to try to open my mind to her chess technique."
    "...Although I can never tell if she's actually trying to teach me or just finds this funny."
    
    "By the time I say goodbye to Hikari, it's getting late. It'll be dusk before too long, but Mirako's more active than usual."
    "I pass a tall guy in glasses I recognize as a student council member, carrying a stack of chairs out of the old wing. Guess this festival's a full time job for them."
    "Outside, I take a seat on a picnic table by the front entrance. I'm just dragging my feet at this point. There's nothing much waiting me back at the dorm but the mountain of makeup work I've got in my bag. Hopefully Kenta hasn't turned the room into a post office yet."
    "When I finally rally myself to leave, I notice a silhouette heading the opposite direction. They're carrying a sack that looks like... baseball gear?"
    takeru "Oh. Natsumi, it's you."
    natsumi "Yo! Hey Takeru."
    "She shields her eyes against the sun, then starts heading my way."
    takeru "Isn't it kind of late for you to be hanging around? No practice to run today?"
    natsumi "We're catching a train to regionals tomorrow. I'm just making sure all our stuff's packed."
    "She dumps the bag of gear on the ground next to her."
    natsumi "Glad I caught you before I left, actually. You're not doing anything important, right? Cool."
    natsumi "Let's take a walk. Or actually... Catch!"
    "She tosses me a glove. Underhand, thankfully, although for a moment I have a flashback to her chucking a textbook at my face. I still don't like where this is going."
    natsumi "Now catch this."
    takeru "I really wouldn't trust me with a b-baseball."
    natsumi "This one's a softball, you dope. Just catch with me a bit."
    "She throws the ball overhand and my reflexes kick in. I throw it back more to get rid of the thing than anything else, but of course, Natsumi just tosses it right back."
    natsumi "Don't strain yourself. Especially not if that shoulder thing is real."
    takeru "Is that what this is about? Unless you want to tie me up and throw me in the luggage compartment, you're not getting me on that train tomorrow."
    natsumi "No, no, it's the opposite of that. I should probably apologize."
    takeru "For what?"
    "It's not that she doesn't have anything to apologize for, I'm just curious what in particular is compelling her to start now."
    natsumi "Oh you know. The whole Tohoku thing."
    natsumi "I wasn't kidding when I said I was scouting you out from the beginning. That's the whole reason I introduced myself. Your old school's a little famous, you know?"
    takeru "I'm aware."
    natsumi "I'm not sure if Meiko just made that thing up about your shoulder injury or told her that, but I think I kind of get it. This is Mirako, right? People who transfer here have their own problems to deal with."
    natsumi "So, sorry. I kind of ignored that. I figured something was up with you, but your stats looked so good... I mean I had to give it a shot, right?"
    natsumi "But if Meiko's willing to go to bat for you... Yeah I can respect that."
    takeru "Please tell me this means you're calling off your mastermind recruitment plan."
    natsumi "Yep. Cancelled that a while ago. I've just been too busy to tell you I screwed up. Plus I was a little bitter there. Our pitching staff's not looking so hot and it's going to take a miracle this week to reach championships."
    takeru "Sorry I couldn't help out."
    natsumi "Hey, back off a little bit. I know it's a softball but you and I can both throw farther than that."
    takeru "If you really want to shout at me across the Mirako front lawn, be my guest."
    natsumi "Hey, it's no skin off my back."
    natsumi "Anyway, it's funny, when I called all those old Tohoku students, most of them said were an overconfident jerk. Which is pretty much what I'd expect from a high school kid with a fastball in the 70s."
    natsumi "But then you get here and you're a bit of a stick in the mud, but nice enough I guess. Kind of funny. I'll probably give up bugging you about joining the team and just try to get you to join us for lunch."
    "I'll keep that in mind when Mana and Hagami start staging occult ceremonies at lunchtime."
    natsumi "But that's not important. Here, fly ball."
    "She hurls the softball straight up."
    "After four seconds of confusion, I hear at land two feet behind me. Natsumi laughs and walks in."
    natsumi "You're a terrible fielder."
    takeru "It was never that important. And I'm out of practice."
    natsumi "Excuses, excuses."
    natsumi "Listen, I've got to catch a train, but what I really wanted to say..."
    natsumi "If the baseball gods are smiling on us, I won't be back until the day of the festival. Can you..."
    natsumi "Watch our for Meiko for me."
    takeru "I guess I can do that. Is there any particular - "
    natsumi "Meiko's a superhero, right? The mental strength of ten men and the brightest mind of our generation. Last year, though, after the festival..."
    natsumi "She took it pretty rough."
    takeru "You mean... That student's death?"
    natsumi "After the festival she was only hospitalized. I didn't know Meiko too well back then but from what I hear..."
    natsumi "She was involved."
    takeru "Well she was on the council, right?"
    natsumi "Not like that."
    natsumi "I dunno. I'm not trying to throw accusations around. It's like I said though. Most out-of-towners at Mirako came here for a reason."
    natsumi "So don't let her do anything too off wall while I'm gone, okay? I don't think it's actually possible for her to work herself to death, but she'll probably try."
    takeru "Er, I'll keep that in mind."
    natsumi "Okay. Knew I could count on you. Team player after all, huh?"
    natsumi "Now I've got to finish lugging all this stuff down the hill... Give me a hand?"
    takeru "Oh, so this was all a ploy to get me to help you pack."
    natsumi "I swear it wasn't! You can go home if you want but I'll judge you forever."
    takeru "Fine, fine... Where to?"
    "I'm headed the same way anyway."
    "The bag is certainly heavy enough. It's overloaded with what feels like three bats for every member of the team. I have no idea how Natsumi intended to move this more than ten yards."
    "I'm still trying to think what Natsumi meant though and I'm not about to ask for clarification."
    "Involved?"
    "Maybe I'll ask Hikari."
    "Until then, time to send off Natsumi, and wish her good luck."

label day12:

    "I've never been much of a morning person, but today is especially rough."
    "By the time into homeroom, there's nowhere I'd rather be than back in bed."
    "Everything from the 40th anniversary festival sign at the gates to the students students I say hello to in the hall seem to give off an air of excitement, but this early I really don't care how many days it is until the festival."
    "I slump into my seat, next to Natsumi's empty desk. I must be on time for once, because Meiko isn't at the front of the room speaking and instead giving me a wary look from the next desk over."
    meiko "Having a good morning, Takeru? You look a little tired."
    takeru "I'm exhausted. All of muscles are exhausted so I can't tell what hurts."
    meiko "What exactly were you up to last night?"
    takeru "Insect distribution."
    meiko "Are you feeling alright?"
    takeru "No, no, I'm fine. Well, not really, but this is just physical. Kenta's shipping out his dead bug collection, and I..."
    meiko "His what?"
    takeru "Long story, but he's not into coins any more. Or insects. I guess he only cares about the frogs any more. Seriously, his hobby is pretty much finding new hobbies."
    takeru "You wouldn't think boxes of bugs would be very heavy, but all that glass and bubble wrap adds up, and when you have to take ten loads down to the post office..."
    meiko "And you volunteered for this?"
    takeru "Have you seen my dorm room? It was either haul packages or sleep under a hundred bug boxes. It was a tough call, but I made the right one."
    meiko "I'm glad to hear Kenta's doing well."
    takeru "Easy for you to say. I wonder what happened to his last roommate..."
    "Probably he was crushed under boxes in his sleep."
    takeru "Anyway, I've got that club paperwork set. I'll get it to you after class today I guess."
    meiko "Good. I'll book your friend a slot."
    meiko "Does this also mean then... About that box in the gym..."
    takeru "I took care of it. Sort of. It's in the piano room downstairs. Bad news on the refund though."
    meiko "That's not as important. I'm sure the council cares, but to me..."
    takeru "The company already booked the technician for Saturday so they're going to charge you guys either way. You'll have to call the day of to cancel."
    meiko "I was afraid of that."
    meiko "Thanks for taking care of it, Takeru. When it comes to the fireworks it seems like I have a hit of a block."
    takeru "Right..."
    "A block? Like what Natsumi was talking about?"
    "I almost want to ask her about Hikari, but that sounds like it'd be a bad idea at the moment. Classes are set to start any minute anyway."
    "Right as the teacher enters, though, the hair raises on the back of my neck."
    "Like... there's something behind me?"
    "I turn around. Nothing."
    "I should probably start paying attention to the lesson, but..."
    "Strange. I almost expected to see her."
    "When I turned around again, I spy her. Hikari. Somewhere in the last few minutes she slipped in and commandeered an open seat."
    "But she's not looking at me this time. She's only watching Meiko."
    "With a jerky motion of her neck, she spies me. And in the next moment..."
    "Was she even there? The desk at the back of the room is empty."
    "That's strange, even for Hikari. I'd almost think she was... a ghost?"
    "Is that what her mystery memory illness is?"
    "I do my best to put her out of mind and get through morning classes. All this means is I need to do whatever I can for Hagami. I have to count on her to figure this out."
    
    "Meiko's gone almost the instant the bell sounds for lunch. I'm sure it'll be all hands on deck at the student council until the festival's over and done with."
    "There's no sign of Hikari either. I did see her earlier? Right?"
    "I run over my morning just to be sure. I definitely took my meds. In between the groaning to Kenta and kicking around those extra boxes, I definitely took my meds."
    "I finally reach the old library."
    "Mana should be back, but... The only sound inside is faint."
    "I push open the door."
    takeru "Hey Hagami."
    hagami "...Hey."
    "The sounds is the radio. Specifically, that same old recording. Piano, and that must be a cello accompanying it."
    takeru "Mana's not out sick again is she?"
    hagami "Just busy. She's on the swim team."
    takeru "Oh, right, they were putting something together for the festival. Hopefully she's free before lunch is over. I was going to tell her the club registration is going through fine."
    hagami "That... Good."
    takeru "It's going to be a long day today though. Especially with whatever torture you've got lined up tonight."
    hagami "Hm."
    "Even as I'm talking she taps a button on the radio, and the sound shuts off."
    takeru "I don't mind the music, really. I meant the er, seance, or whatever you called it."
    hagami "I know."
    takeru "...That's your parents on the disc, right?"
    "Today Hagami has a stack of books in front of her, some the usual hardcover tomes, some skinnier, and the one she's got open totday is entitled \"Field Notes on a Haunting in Abkhazia.\" Hagami's flipping pages at a breakneck speed today, but when I ask my question, she stops completely."
    hagami "Yes."
    hagami "I should use a different version..."
    "Faster than I can follow, she works the CD controls to eject the disc and pops in another. There's an introduction in German this time, but I recognize the melody as the same. It's a piano with full orchestra this time."
    hagami "...You probably think that's cowardly, though. Oh well."
    takeru "Cowardly? What's that supposed to mean?"
    hagami "You told me... Well..."
    "She tries to bury herself in the book again, but I can tell she's faking. She keeps glancing up at me. I stare her down, but I'm the one who ends up feeling uncomfortable."
    "There's only the tinny noise from the radio between us. Finally Hagami breaks the silence."
    hagami "You don't remember."
    takeru "Remember? Don't tell me..."
    hagami "That day, before you went to the clinic. I guessed you didn't know what was going on, but..."
    takeru "No, I really didn't. I thought I had a pretty good idea of what was real and was wasn't, but I guess I missed something."
    "Hagami tries to flip a page, but ends up flipping two. She gives up and closes the book with a dull thud."
    hagami "No, you didn't."
    takeru "Hagami, I'm not that dumb. I can tell something happened. I was really worried the first day I was back, because I knew you bailed me out, but then you acted like it was nothing and..."
    takeru "It really was an act, wasn't it? For a while there it was like the first day I met you."
    hagami "You..."
    hagami "That day you were someone I didn't know."
    takeru "Right. Hang on a second..."
    "I rub my head, trying to think. A sudden headache isn't helping. Obviously, I screwed up more than I thought I did."
    "I could drop it. I don't need to know. Hagami's over it, at least somewhat. She at least talks to me. Isn't that good enough?"
    "Then there's my curiosity. It's not curiousity, really, it's sort of a morbid suspicion. If I don't know what happened that day, I'll always assume it was the worst thing possible. After all, that's how it turned out at Tohoku, right?"
    "It couldn't have been that bad. I didn't injure anyone."
    "Did I?"
    "In my efforts to look at anything but Hikari, the stack of books catches my eye."
    "Characteristics and Classifications of Classic Japanese Spirits..." "A Practical Taxonomy to Native Old World Ghosts..."
    "It's Hikari reading material."
    "If I want to help Hikari, I need to be decent terms with Hagami. I can't be dancing around in the dark, never sure when I'll be stepping on her toes because of some sin I don't even remember. I have to know."
    takeru "You can tell me."
    hagami "It's fine. Over."
    takeru "Look, I don't think... I want to go back to before that ever happened."
    hagami "I worried if you knew the details you'd run off."
    takeru "I'm not going anywhere. I need you to help my friend, right? I don't think we're going to be able to work together unless..."
    hagami "Alright."
    
    "Hagami has a unique way of telling a story. I don't think I've ever heard her say so many words at once before, but it's all almost... sparse?"
    "I know I was here, that day, in the old library. Hagami was here too, just her. We talked about... The club? Her application form? Something like that?"
    "She doesn't bother telling me that. In between those silences, she just explains..."
    "That day there was something wrong."
    "I couldn't place my finger on it then, but it's all too obvious now what was causing it. The books on the selves all running together into an indistinguishable patch of colors. The unsaturated look of the sunlight."
    "I just left Natsumi after physics. It's lunch now and I'm headed for the old library."
    "My eye hurts. Right, I have that black eye from where I stumbled into Kenta's half-finished cabinet. But I can't really feel it. Am I disembodied? I don't feel quite myself."
    "That's the script for this day. The lunch bell, I go to the old library, something happens, and all of a sudden Hagami treats me like a stranger."
    "I know I said I wanted to know what happened..."
    "But each step I take towards the old wing, there's that foreboding."
    "I know something terrible will happen when I reach that room."
    "Then why am I still walking?"
    "It was the same sensation from before -- I'm not in control of my actions, all I can do is what beta-Takeru did before me. My thoughts aren't my thoughts. Their his."
    "I stop dead in the hall."
    "That never happened the first time I was here."
    "I can feel the adrenaline now. Up that staircase, there's the door to the old library."
    "The first time, I went up that staircase, opened that door, and upset everything with Hagami."
    "Why should I go there now?"
    "I could turn around right here, go back to class, and it would never happen."
    "That's why my heart is pounding. I realize that nothing I know is set in stone. It can all change. But do I take that choice? Can I, now, wherever I am, change what should already have happened?"
    
    menu:
        "This is just my memory. Go upstairs and open the door.":
            
            "That's right, this is just..."
            "Hagami's story. I'll hear her out. I said I had to know, didn't I?"
            "I walk again. One stair, then five stairs, then I'm outside the library."
            "Someone opens the door. Me, of course."
            takeru "Hey Hagami."
            hagami "...Hello."
            takeru "I guess Mana's still sick?"
            "And so on."
            "Right, I know this. This is still my version of what happened. Until now all that had happened today was Hikari kept turning up where I didn't expect her, and saying that... accusatory stuff."
            "That's supposed to change when she turns on the radio."
            "She doesn't turn on the radio. When was that supposed to happen?"
            "We chat about Mana, then about her festival application. Then quiet."
            "It was supposed to happen now, right? She turns on the radio, then I hear her voice."
            "The minutes flow on, and still nothing. In my impatience I turn it on myself"
            "I've never been much good at operating the antique radio/CD player, but this time it crackles on. Another old recording, starting off with an introduction, thankfully in Japanese."
            "It's a solo performance by Inori Keiji, some classic. His first public appearance in years, and so amazing that he performs at all after -"
            "A hand darts out and flicks a knob on the radio. Fast forward? The voice scrambles, then fades into the sounds of string instrument, unaccompanied. A cello, right. It's a slow piece, almost lethargic."
            "Then Hagami shuts it off completely."
            hagami "Sorry."
            takeru "What was that?"
            "She's quiet."
            "Then I straighten up. As if I'd just heard a gunshot ten feet behind me."
            "And I start speaking."
            takeru "Are you busy? You never speak to me. I never hear from you. I eat lunch every day here but I know you still don't trust me. The paper. That old CD. Her voice. You recorded her voice? Is that a joke?"
            takeru "You won't explain? It really isn't funny. It's betrayal."
            takeru "It's painful. You obviously know all about me. You know what's wrong with me. You know I got kicked out of dream school for being a psychopath. I don't know the first thing about you. Me against the world."
            "Hagami just stares in disbelief."
            takeru "You keep running away. That's fine. I won't trust you either. I'm stronger now."
            takeru "I was depressed when I came here, probably. Mana found me and brought me here. Right. That's okay. I'm not depressed any more, just furious."
            takeru "One day I'll get even, You'll think I'm there for you, and then..."
            "What? What is this? Why do I know these words like the back of my hand? I've never spoken them before. No. I've heard them before. Where did I hear this?"
            "It's Meiko's voice. Of course. All I'm saying to Hagami now is what I heard from Meiko's tape. Her exact language in some spots."
            "Then... Wait."
            "I freeze."
            "If there was no tape, where did this even come from? It can't be that... It wasn't Meiko talking to me. I was talking to Hagami. Obviously."
            "All that hate I felt coming from the phantom voice on the radio... It came from me? Because of some imagined insult from Hikari about a clearly nonexistent secret recording?"
            "It's idiotic, only I could manage to pull that. But there's nothing for it now. It's runaway downhill. She's trying to shield herself with that book but I have to keep going."
            takeru "I can't forgive you. You'll never realize it, will you. You can try to keep your secrets but I know you betrayed me. I'll never forget. I'll find out whatever happened to you, on that last day. I'll find out why your're really here."
            takeru "That won't be a secret either."
            takeru "I can do anything. No consequences."
            "When did I stand up? Hagami's huddled behind her book, but I'm standing over it. She has nowhere to look but right at me."
            takeru "I told you. Hikari."
            takeru "Hikari."
            takeru "Who are you?"
            hagami "Hagami?"
            takeru "Do I look stupid?"
            "She flinches."
            takeru "I didn't get enough sleep but I'm not that dumb. I can tell who I'm talking to."
            takeru "Everyone lying, hiding, running away... When did you all figure out what happened to me? On that last day at Tohoku? Because it's happening now."
            "Hagami stands up. No doubt making a break for the door. I take a step back. Am I supposed to stop her? What am I even..."
            "I'm falling."
            "And I know in that moment, yes, she was trying to escape. I was long gone. She was halfway to the hall, then when I stumbled, she turned back."
            "She caught me."
            "That's when she wound up behind me. She came back for me."
            hagami "Come on."
            takeru "D-did you see..."
            "Did you see Hikari? No, obviously, she was never there."
            hagami "Come on."
            takeru "You're frightened."
            hagami "...Yes."
            "And now I know why."
            "Then, of course, Kenta shows up. More likely she found Kenta, to try to get him to deal with me because I'd practically attacked her in the library. And Kenta fumbles around, and it's Hikari that ends up with me at the nurse's office."
            "But she still waits for me."
            "And even at the end of the day, she's the one guiding me back home."
            "When we part ways, I'm a bit of a mess. Gloomy, silent, still sporting that black eye."
            "I thank her. In retrospect it obviously wasn't enough."
            "It's exactly what I remember, but..."
            "Does that mean what I now remember is the truth?"
            "That must be it. No wonder Hagami steered clear of me after that day."
            "I open my eyes, although I don't remember closing them."
            "Hagami's still paging through the old world ghosts taxonomy. The radio's still playing just above audible."
            "Now I know the truth. That's the easy part. The hard part is making it up to her. I don't really have a strategy for that, but I can at least start small."
            takeru "Thanks for telling me."
            hagami "You asked."
            takeru "Yeah. That was probably for you to remember than it was for me to hear about it. I didn't realize. I should apologize."
            "Is there really nothing else I can do?"
            "There's another minute of silence, with just static from the radio. I'm not sure if I should try to turn the volume up or just leave. Mostly I'm ashamed of myself and the longer I stick around the worse it's going to get."
            "There's a soft thump. When I look up, Hagami has shut her book. Probably she's realized I'm pointless to deal with and is on her way to the door, but instead, she lays her arms down over the closed taxonomy and props her head on them."
            hagami "I want to help."
            takeru "You what?"
            takeru "I mean, I see you're already trying to research Hikari, that's great. I'm not sure if - "
            hagami "I want to help you."
            takeru "Me."
            "She mumbles, then waits a moment before speaking in earnest."
            hagami "I'm slowly trying to fight this... anxiety. I know I must come across as a very strange person. I thought you only stuck around here to hang out with Mana. I know she asked you to come."
            hagami "But even when she's not around..."
            takeru "Er, I'm more glad that you don't avoid me altogether, after what I said back then. Nobody would blame you."
            hagami "It was hard at first, but..."
            hagami "I think I've realized I can learn to live with other people. Not just Mana."
            hagami "So I want to return the favor."
            hagami "If that happens again and you don't know what's happening... Or you think your memory's bad. If that happens..."
            hagami "I'm on your side. I'll believe you."
            takeru "You're great, Hagami. Thank you. You didn't think I was insane when I brought up Hikari. Instead you got out the books and got to work."
            hagami "It's all I'm good at."
            "There's hint of self-mockery in her voice I can't quite place."
            takeru "If there's anything I can do to help your research, let me know. I didn't mean you'd have to go it alone."
            hagami "We'll do it together."
            hagami "Starting tonight."
            takeru "Tonight?"
            "Oh. Right. Dammit."
        
        "It never happened. I won't hurt Hagami. Turn around.":
    
            "It's a funny feeling. Like escaping fate."
            "I have no memory of it, but I turn around and walk back down the hall, away from Hagami, away from the old library."
            "And step by step, I retrace my path back to the classroom."
            "This..."
            "This should be stepping around the problem, right?"
            "I take out my lunch and eat in silence. No one ever eats here. They all head out to the cafeteria, or the tables at the front lawn, or anywhere else to enjoy their lunch with company. I'm just alone."
            "Come to think of it, I've never missed lunch before. Every day since I've arrived at Mirako, I've eaten with either Mana or Hagami up at the old library."
            "With that realization, I know there's something else wrong as well."
            "On some level, I know what my problem is. I didn't take my meds today. I can fix this. Why don't I just go back home?"
            "Then that same feeling of inevitable comes over me again. Like I can only do what I've been programmed to do."
            "Stand up, Takeru. Go home."
            "I rise to my feet, but at that moment..."
            meiko "Takeru? You're back early?"
            takeru "Er... I guess."
            meiko "My meeting ended early so I thought I'd head back. Have you not eaten yet?"
            takeru "Not really. I guess I'm not that hungry."
            meiko "You're feeling alright?"
            takeru "Yeah. I guess."
            meiko "Sorry. I didn't mean to intrude. You just seemed distracted in class."
            takeru "I thought I saw someone is all."
            "I thought I saw Hikari."
            meiko "I see."
            takeru "What was your meeting about? More festival stuff?"
            meiko "The usual. We have a budget we need to stick to, and a few suppliers we need to choose from. It's hard to get everything up the quality standard we need with limited resources."
            meiko "The Mirako cultural festival is well-known, you know? Most of the town turns out. It's important to keep up good relations, or else they might see us as, well..."
            meiko "A bunch of mental patients."
            takeru "And we're more than that, right."
            "She nods. I'm not sure she caught the insincerity in my voice."
            "On my part, I'm not sure where I'm going with this. I'm trying to string together a conversation long enough until I figure out what's going on. I shouldn't be able to do this, should I?"
            meiko "We couldn't get the fireworks cancelled before they ship, so it looks like our finances will suffer. We'll just have to try for a refund later."
            takeru "I never understood it. Is it really your call that the fireworks are cancelled this year? I thought it was some big Mirako tradition."
            meiko "...It is. To both."
            "She looks offput. I probably brought up something I shouldn't have. That doesn't matter though, does it? None of this happened anyway."
            "When Meiko doesn't continue, I figure I might as well follow up."
            takeru "It was something to do with her, right? With Hikari?"
            takeru "Are you too busy to answer?"
            "She's quiet."
            "Then I straighten up. Bolt upright. I recognize my words, even as I'm speaking them. I've heard them before, I'm just repeating like off a tape recording, but..."
            takeru "It's your secret, isn't it?"
            meiko "My... What?"
            meiko "Takeru, I told you, it's not something I want to think about. Whenever I even hear her name... How could you even know that - "
            takeru "You won't explain? It really isn't funny. It's betrayal."
            takeru "Don't you know all about me? At Tohoku? You even explained to Meiko... That lie..."
            meiko "Takeru, what are you talking about?"
            "That hasn't happened yet, has it? But it makes sense to me. My stream of consciousness flows downhill, something natural, more natural than I've never felt."
            takeru "It's painful. You obviously know all about me. You know what's wrong with me. You know I got kicked out of my dream school for being a psychopath. I don't know the first thing about you. Me against the world."
            meiko "I only know what you've told me. I always figured there was a reason..."
            takeru "You keep running away. That's fine. I won't trust you either. I'm stronger now."
            meiko "Takeru... I've been over that. For so long. I know I just told you yesterday, but I thought we understood each other. It hurt me, badly. But I didn't..."
            meiko "I'm lost, Takeru. I don't understand you. All of a sudden you bring up her name... What do you even know?"
            takeru "I don't know. You won't tell me. You never trusted me to begin with. But I'll find out whatever happened to you. You'll try to keep your secrets but I'll know you betrayed me."
            takeru "I'll find out what happened to you, on that last day. I'll find out why you're really here."
            "It's garbled, but I recognize my words."
            "I know them from the tape Hagami played back. Then I thought they were Meiko's words. Now I realize they were mine."
            "All that derision I felt from that CD, that I thought was Meiko's hatred of me. Now I know it must've been mine for her."
            takeru "I counted on you when I first came here. And you released Natsumi on me, set me up to fail all your little jobs, and did whatever it was to make sure I felt as though I'd made a mistake coming here."
            takeru "And I trusted you. What did you ever trust me with?"
            meiko "T-Takeru. You're different."
            takeru "I know what I'm talking about now. Yesterday we couldn't talk to each other. I felt guilty, so did you. Only now I never had nothing to feel guilty about. You were right. I should've never thanked you."
            meiko "You're entitled to feel that way."
            "Her eyes are erratic. Panicking? Hurt. I guess I meant to hurt her. But her voice is flat, emotionless."
            "In contrast to my own speech, which I realize is quickly becoming incomprehensible."
            takeru "I'll figure out what you... With Hikari. I know something. Whatever happened... Last year you..."
            meiko "I get it."
            "That look in her eyes is gone. She stands."
            meiko "That's why you left Tohoku, isn't it? Times like this. 'Episodes' aren't they called?"
            meiko "Get help."
            "Meiko's voice quivers but she turns and leaves the room all the same. I'm left alone again, staring after her like an idiot."
            "Do I chase her down? That seems like an even more stupid plan."
            "Instead I wander off into the hall. There is no destination. This whole time I've been convinced what I'm seeing can't actually be happening, but now it feels like I've run off a cliff and my legs keep pedaling air."
            "It couldn't have been me saying those things. It was from that recording. Wasn't I just quoting Meiko back at herself? It wasn't me saying that was it? None of this happened anyway."
            "Down the hallway, I spot someone who can at least bring me back to reality."
            takeru "Hey Kenta."
            kenta "How should I know - "
            kenta "Good afternoon, Takeru. There you are."
            "I realize he's speaking to someone else."
            hagami "Hello."
            takeru "Sorry I didn't show up for lunch. I knew I would screw up, so I didn't come, but I managed to - "
            takeru "It's kind of a long story. I'm not even sure that what's happening right now is..."
            takeru "I'm not dreaming, am I? Misremembering?"
            kenta "What are you talking about, Takeru?"
            "I realize I'm just babbling at this point. It's probably been a while since I was coherent. Could Meiko even understand me?"
            "Or maybe I am talking straight, it's just with what I know about today, I sound out of my mind."
            "How am I here, anyway? Retracing my steps..."
            "Kenta and Hagami have their argument."
            "Hagami walks me to the nurse."
            "I didn't take my meds. Of course."
            "It's all exactly the same. It's a memory after all. This is just what I remember happening."
            
            "I open my eyes."
            "The old library. Is it still lunchtime? The radio murmurs at an almost imperceptibly quiet volume."
            "Hagami is sitting there, book closed, eyebrow raised."
            takeru "Er, sorry. I might've gotten carried away. What were you saying?"
            hagami "You weren't saying anything."
            hagami "Or... Unless you mean about that Wednesday."
            hagami "Sound like you probably upset Meiko back then. It's a good thing I found you when I did."
            "Hagami smiles at me. Still low key, but not a hint of shyness in it."
            hagami "You had me worried, you know. When you didn't turn up."
            hagami "Kenta said you came this morning. And... Honestly it was a little difficult dealing with him."
            takeru "It always is. Thanks again for bailing me out."
            hagami "If I can help with Meiko, let me know... She put in that favor for me with the festival application so I feel like I should be grateful."
            takeru "I guess."
            "I try to take a moment to collect my thoughts."
            "I've had this feeling once before. Way back when I first came to Mirako, Meiko told me that story. Back when we were kids, we took the train to visit her parents' grave. And I bought her a ribbon."
            "Somehow I had remembered that all incorectly. Either I saw that color incorrectly , or it changed, suddenly, to reflect how I remembered it."
            "That's what's happened again."
            "Did I just misremember that day with Hagami? When I was off my meds, I didn't even set foot in the old library. I guess that makes sense. Of course my memory was wrong, I was practically hallucinating at the time."
            "That day, I turned around, went back the classroom, accused Meiko of betraying me, then ran into Hagami."
            "Then why do I remember Hagami being so distant those next few days? Like I'd done something unforgivable?"
            hagami "You're quiet."
            takeru "Am I? That's a little strange to here from you."
            hagami "Not really."
            takeru "Sorry, guess I'm just out of it today. Don't worry, I took my meds. Just a headache this time. And maybe some deja vu."
            hagami "That's okay."
            "She picks up a textbook from the pile next to her."
            "Odd. I can't remember ever actually having a conversation with her when she didn't have a book propped in front of her."
            "And since when is silence between us something new? As far as I know that's the status quo."
            "Hagami glances up from the page. I must be staring. She smiles again, but I see she has an eyebrow raised."
            "It looks like I'm not so threatening any more. Her lunch is pretty much gone. I'm the one with a bunch of uneaten food in front of me. I'm really not tempted by it at the moment. In fact I'm nauseous. I seem to have lost my footing, stumbled again."
    
    "Right on cue, Mana stumbles through the door."
    mana "Hey guys! Are you ready for the seance tonight?"
    mana "How's lunch going? Do you know how long until class? I just got done with the swim team and I haven't had a bite to eat."
    "Hagami and I watch on as Mana unloads her lunch onto the table, not stopping to clear a place. A carton winds up on the Japanese spirit classication guide. She doesn't stop talking until she starts eating, and even then, it's two minutes before she's back in action."
    mana "So! Seance! You guys are getting ready?"
    takeru "What exactly does this involve?"
    mana "Ask our high priestess."
    hagami "Please don't call me that."
    mana "But you told me - "
    hagami "Never mind."
    "No doubt Hagami only called herself that the first time to terrify me."
    hagami "We'll meet here. I have the books."
    mana "And the robes."
    "Hagami gives Mana a vaguely incredulous look I thought was reserved for me."
    hagami "Yes."
    hagami "Takeru, the club... You're registering today?"
    takeru "As soon as I get that last signature. Hikari said she would but..."
    takeru "Yeah. I'll definitely do it."
    mana "And we're gonna meet our fourth member?"
    hagami "In spirit."
    takeru "Er..."
    mana "Hagami's plans are the best. Just go with it!"
    takeru "I'm getting nervous."
    mana "What's the matter? Afraid of ghosts? You're a supernatural club member now! We can't have that."
    takeru "According to the paperwork, I think we're actually the something something Ghost Hunt Union and Supernatural Society."
    "Hagami snorts, then quickly tries to bury herself behind her book."
    mana "I uh, was just being creative."
    takeru "Yeah? Well thanks."
    "I silently vow to do something, anything at notable at Mirako so that that terrible club name doesn't get printed under my photo on the yearbook. My dignity's taking enough hits already."
    
    "Meiko shows up late to class, and ten minutes before the final bell, she makes some excuse to the teacher and she's out the door again."
    "I realize I should've probably found Hikari earlier in the day, or insisted she sign on last night, so that I could get the papers to Meiko. Now she's gone and it looks like I'll have to be handing them in at the office."
    "First, to find Hikari. That shouldn't be so hard."
    "She's in the tea room, unsurprisingly. But I never remember seeing her sitting there at the table when I first walk in. She has an amazing ability to always sneak up behind me."
    "Today she's already there, sitting on the floor and staring at a variety of chess pieces lined up before her."
    takeru "Hey Hikari."
    hikari "Hi."
    takeru "All those all new pieces?"
    hikari "Well they aren't the old ones."
    "The pieces are all cut at harsh angles. Octagonal? And the bright colors are gone. I sit down and join Hikari."
    takeru "Looks like there are a lot more pieces there than you need for one set though, right?"
    hikari "This looks like all I'll be doing for a while, so I might as well get used to it."
    takeru "What do you mean?"
    hikari "Takeru, what did you do all day?"
    takeru "Er... Talked to Meiko, struggled through physics, got set up for a hilarious practical joke tonight..."
    hikari "And later today?"
    takeru "Probably homework, ship out some bugs, and er... Hopefully not wear any robes."
    hikari "Today I carved chess pieces. Guess what I'll be doing tonight."
    takeru "Okay. I get it."
    hikari "Before I met you I used to be content with just stewing here and harassing anyone if they wandered by."
    hikari "Now everything feels empty."
    takeru "Sorry."
    hikari "I wouldn't expect you to understand. And besides, I'd be happy if anyone would remember me. Or if I could remember anyone, as it turns out."
    takeru "About that... You have the papers for the club?"
    hikari "I do. I signed them."
    takeru "Thanks. Helping you out with... er, with whatever's got you down is our first order of business as the official supernatural club."
    hikari "You mean the official Mirako Ghost Hunters' Union and - "
    takeru "Nope. Don't remind me."
    takeru "You said you had that form, though?"
    "She doesn't move. I don't know where she'd hide it anyway."
    hikari "I'm not showing up to meetings."
    takeru "I guess I kind of expected that. I know you're not a huge fan of Mana, but Hagami's pretty level-headed and I think she'd understand more of what she's supposed to be doing if she said hello to you."
    hikari "It's not either of them I'm worried about."
    takeru "Right... That just leaves..."
    "Me."
    takeru "...Did you want to play chess or anything?"
    hikari "Not really."
    takeru "Tea?"
    hikari "..."
    takeru "What's got you down today?"
    hikari "Was it that obvious?"
    takeru "Extremely obvious."
    hikari "I guess I've spent so long away from people that I'd forgotten how to even hide anything."
    takeru "Sorry, but... it was pretty easy to see."
    hikari "I tried to come to class today."
    takeru "I had an eye out for you. In the morning or the afternoon?"
    hikari "I went to the wrong classroom. I'd completely forgotten what you looked like."
    takeru "Oh."
    "I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say. It's gotten that bad?"
    hikari "None of this happened before I met you, by the way. It's new."
    "Something about her voice feels accusatory."
    takeru "Do you think - "
    hikari "It's not your fault."
    hikari "Have you ever wondered why you're here? Existentially?"
    takeru "Not quite sure what that word's supposed to mean, but not really. No one's here to do anything, right? We just do what we can."
    hikari "That's easier to say when you aren't some being whose existence has to be researched by a high school occultist club."
    hikari "I had never wondered up until now."
    hikari "It's stupid. Imbecilic, I know. You feel like when you came here you had no opportunity, that everything you had going for you was dead."
    takeru "My baseball career's dead at least."
    hikari "But when you talk about Hagami, about Meiko... Clearly it's not all over."
    hikari "Me, though? I'm just a fluke. There's nothing for me here in the future and I'm slowly losing everything I have in the present."
    hikari "That's what's got me down."
    takeru "We'll save you."
    hikari "Save me?"
    "Her laugh is bitter."
    hikari "I'm already dead, Takeru. The me that could be saved has already died."
    hikari "Thank you for doing what you can, but, I'm not sure what good it'll be."
    takeru "Hagami's the expert. I'm sure she'll find something."
    hikari "If I'm even forgetting you, Takeru..."
    hikari "That's a tall order."
    takeru "Are you sure you don't want tea?"
    hikari "I'm sure."
    hikari "If I seem like I'm overreacting, I'm sorry."
    takeru "No, that's fine. I'll just hand in those papers and head home."
    hikari "They're on the counter. Probably someone in the administration will reject a dead student from your little club, but..."
    hikari "I did what I could."
    takeru "Thanks, Hikari."
    "I still don't quite understand though. No one was demanding she show up to the supernatural club. Was this really that big a thing to ask of her? There must be something I'm not understanding still."
    takeru "I guess I should go drop these papers off."
    hikari "I'll come with you."
    takeru "You sure?"
    hikari "I've been enough of a stick in the mud for today. I'll at least get out of this room once today. Unless you'd rather not have me tail you around."
    takeru "That's fine."
    
    "With the paperwork in hand, we head for the office."
    "Trying not to let Hikari notice, I check the form for her signature. Sure enough, it's all there. Her handwriting is awful though. Every line is blocky and jagged. I could've done better left-handed."
    "Then again, I should question it. I still have no idea how she managed to get pen to paper. The real test is going to be if the people at the office will even accept her name. In retrospect, I could've just forged some random student's name and it would've been easier."
    "Or bugged Kenta to join. But then he'd probably actually show up, which would be a fitting punishment."
    hikari "Did you think I hadn't filled it in?"
    takeru "Er, oh. You saw that."
    hikari "Takeru, you're many things, but subtle isn't one of them."
    takeru "I was just making sure. I've kind of gotten the impression this is important to Hagami so I'd like to not screw it up."
    hikari "You do talk about her a lot. But I still don't know much of what she's like."
    takeru "Not someone you knew last year?"
    hikari "No. Or maybe I've forgotten her. Hard to tell."
    hikari "I take it you worked things out with her? The day before you left for the clinic, you were falling apart a bit in the tearoom."
    takeru "That's a bit embarassing."
    hikari "If you want my advice you just have to deal with it. I take it if you're registering this ridiculous club for her then things are going fine."
    takeru "Er, it's tought to tell. Things got a little muddled."
    hikari "Maybe I'll have to meet her myself."
    takeru "You might scare her off."
    hikari "Oh please. I look nothing like a ghost. I'm elegant, not scary."
    "If I failed at hiding my looking through the papers, I definitely failed hiding my laughter."
    hikari "Is that funny? Are you calling me inelegant?"
    takeru "I don't want to argue that one, but I meant she'd steer clear of you just because you're a person with a strong sense of, er, elegance. If you showed up as ghost I think she'd almost be less frightened."
    hikari "...Interesting."
    "Finally we're at the school entrance, right outside the office."
    "I start to open the door, but no sooner do I grab the handle then someone opens it from the other side, knocking me off balance."
    "I reach out and someone catches me. Not Hikari. Meiko. She pulls me up."
    meiko "Are you alright?"
    "We're about a foot from each other. She takes several steps back and I almost fall over again."
    takeru "I'm fine. Just a bit - "
    "I probably look like I'm stumbling around, but I'm just trying to figure out where Hikari went. She was right next to me, wasn't she?"
    takeru "Just dropping off the club forms. Everything should be set."
    meiko "I can take those."
    takeru "R-right."
    "She flips through them while my heartbeat accelerates. But she doesn't complain. She seems uninterested. Distracted?"
    meiko "This looks in order. I'll finalize Hagami's spot."
    takeru "Thanks, Meiko. Sorry to drag this thing out."
    meiko "Don't worry about it."
    meiko "Are you..."
    meiko "Never mind, it's late, I won't hold you up."
    takeru "I'm probably going to be here until this evening, anyway. It's fine."
    "There's no point in heading back to the dorms if I have to be here later for whatever terrible event Hagami has in mind."
    meiko "Really? Well..."
    meiko "Do you remember where you put that box from yesterday? I couldn't find it in the old wing, and we need that shipping receipt for the council records."
    takeru "Yeah. Piano room."
    meiko "I could've sworn I checked there."
    takeru "I can just pick it up. There's nothing better to do."
    meiko "Thanks."
    "I turn to go, but just when I'm starting to look for Hikari, I realize Meiko's walking beside me."
    meiko "You look surprised."
    takeru "Er, I guess I didn't realize - "
    meiko "Sorry, I thought you were showing me where the box was."
    takeru "Right. I can do that."
    meiko "Um..."
    meiko "Although I do have that council meeting. I've got to run to the library. Do you mind just getting me the receipt tomorrow? There should be a clipboard with - "
    takeru "I know it. I'll see you at homeroom, if that works."
    meiko "Okay. See you."
    takeru "Yeah. Later."
    "She heads off the other direction, head held high."
    "I'm left staring after her and scratching my head. Actually I'm more nursing my face where the door hit it. It's funny. Every time I talk to her now is like that. Short, punctuated, and I have no clue what to make of it afterwards."
    hikari "Interesting."
    takeru "Great. Now you decide to show back up."
    takeru "Eavesdropping really is your hobby, isn't it?"
    hikari "That was a very boring conversation."
    takeru "You just said it was interesting."
    hikari "You and Meiko were a lot more interesting than the conversation."
    takeru "Yeah, things are a little strange. I'm sure she still hates me."
    hikari "Still hung up on that?"
    "We start walking back to the old wing. Might as well pick up that receipt now."
    takeru "You don't seem to believe me, but that's what she said. So if things looked strange... We still have to be civil to each other."
    hikari "You looked more confused."
    takeru "Er, I'm not sure what else you want. She's upset if I thank her, but it's not like I can't forgive her, so - "
    hikari "You're funny. She sounded even more confused though, so you're excused."
    takeru "You know, I'm starting to think it'd be more convenient for me if you really would just stay in that tea room."
    hikari "I'm hurt."
    takeru "You're smirking."
    hikari "Doubly hurt."
    
    "The old wing is as silent as ever. Even with more bustle down here due to the festival, everyone's gone home at this point."
    "With the sun setting, it's actually almost eerie down here."
    "We pass the tea room and an empty classroom, and finally come to the piano room. I suppose it must've been a general purpose music room at one point, but now it's just a storage room that happens to have an upright piano."
    "I push open the door, expecting only dust. Instead I jump backwards. One low chord emanates from the piano before Hagami whips around."
    takeru "Oh, Hagami... It's only you."
    "She's speechless."
    takeru "Sorry if I walked in on... Wait, what did I walk in on? Are you..."
    hagami "Who..."
    "Hagami's staring at Hikari, who to my surprise is still standing behind me."
    takeru "Sorry, she's a friend of mine. Hagami, this is - "
    hikari "Just a friend. Hello, Hagami."
    takeru "N-nice to..."
    hikari "I'll see you later."
    takeru "Hikari, where are you - "
    "Hikari turns to me on her way out the door. I expect that mischevious grin, but instead she nods. I have no idea what she's doing."
    takeru "Sorry about that. She can be a little strange."
    takeru "What's with the piano? Does this mean you're performing for the festival?"
    hagami "Yeah. You knew. Didn't you?"
    takeru "I didn't really think about it too hard."
    takeru "But I saw the newsletter, I guess. For that college your parents went to. Your mother is a pianist, right?"
    hagami "Yeah. She, well... Dad played cello."
    "I notice her eyes are focused somewhere well beyond me. Time to change the subject."
    takeru "I kind of thought that application was a joke at first."
    hagami "I don't joke around, not with music."
    takeru "Wait, didn't you give me that huge history of modern music theory at one point?"
    hagami "I did. Nobody really understands. That's why I try to..."
    hagami "Don't mention this to Mana."
    takeru "You're doing a recital or something at the festival. She's bound to notice. And I don't think she'd judge you for having an interest in classical music. She knows that already, right?"
    hagami "That's not it."
    takeru "I guess I don't understand why you're practicing in secret, then."
    hagami "I might not perform."
    takeru "Why not?"
    "Hagami raises an eyebrow. Oh, right."
    hagami "You've never been to Mirako's festival."
    takeru "No."
    hagami "People. They come from all over, even outside Mirako. It's easy to file some papers, but when I see everyone..."
    takeru "You don't want to get her hopes up if you end up canceling the show. I get it."
    hagami "Mana's too good to me. She stopped asking why I never play any more. I can just imagine her disappointed..."
    takeru "How long have you been practicing down here?"
    hagami "Not long enough."
    takeru "Well you've got a few days before Saturday, right? It's not that bad."
    hagami "Still not long enough."
    takeru "You can just make the call that day then. Hope not too many show up."
    "Hagami frowns. Didn't I read she was in an arts school at some point? It must be counterintuitive to want to perform, but hope the audience is small."
    "Isn't it natural to go for the biggest show possible? We measured that at Tohoku, too. If Natsumi looked through that stat book of hers, she'd see our home game attendance numbers. I didn't fail to deliver those, either."
    takeru "Oh well. Maybe less people will show with the fireworks canceled this year."
    takeru "Although..."
    "I find the crate I dropped off here yesterday and take the clipboard off the top."
    takeru "No, that's dumb. Meiko wouldn't be planning a surprise. She's pretty predictable."
    hagami "Your friend?"
    hagami "That box can't be... fireworks? That's happening?"
    takeru "Just a shipping mistake. At least... Yeah, it's just a shipping mistake. I just came down to grab the papers that came with it. The council wants their money back. Meiko's decision is final after all."
    hagami "Her decision? Hm."
    takeru "Er, I mean, she has the final say, but..."
    hagami "I wonder, though."
    takeru "She's not planning anything. I just run errands, I'm not clear on the details."
    hagami "I always did like the fireworks, but... If it's decided, then it's decided."
    takeru "Right."
    "Hagami turns back to the piano, but apart from that, remains motionless."
    takeru "Look, I was serious when I said I didn't mean to walk in, so I'll head out. Hikari's probably waiting. I doubt you want to practice in front of me, I know zero about music in the first place."
    hagami "It seems I really can't do it..."
    hagami "Although this is motivation, I suppose."
    takeru "Er..."
    hagami "You know what I've got planned for the festival... So I have to deliver now. Don't I?"
    takeru "That's up to you."
    "She turns away again. Maybe that wasn't the answer she was looking for?"
    hagami "Mana will be here pretty soon. I'll come upstairs with you."
    "We start up the staircase in silence. With Hagami, it's something I've gotten used to, sort of. It used to make me uncomfortable, but now it just seems to suit her."
    "What I don't understand is why it was quiet in the hallway. Hikari and I were talking, sure, but shouldn't we have heard the piano on our way through the old wing?"
    "Come to think of it, the only sound I heard was that one chord, three notes."
    "I can't imagine her performing."
    "I can't even imagine her at an arts school, or anywhere but here. On my first day here she struck me as just as much a species exclusive to Mirako as Kenta."
    "The only reason I know any of this is from those Showa College newsletters, right? Maybe there was a reason they were buried in a box, stuffed behind some encyclopedias, and shoved in a cabinet."
    "I suddenly remember my own box. Filled with my Tohoku uniforms and souveneirs, pushed into the bottom drawer of the dresser."
    "We all do have our secrets, don't we?"
    "I don't blame Hagami for practicing alone. I get the impression that even that small step makes her more courageous than me."
    
    "When we arrive at the old library, Mana is already waiting."
    mana "Hagami! And Takeru too? What took you so long?"
    takeru "I don't think we ever set a real time, did we?"
    mana "The evening! When you're in occult circles, that always means the witching our. Sunset! The time between day and night when magic is most - "
    takeru "Okay, yeah, I get it, sorry to keep you waiting."
    takeru "I guess the most important question is whether I need robes for this, er, whatever this is. Seance."
    mana "Probably not, but I know how much you like the costumes Takeru, so I had Hagami get everything washed."
    takeru "I mean, I'm fine without - "
    hagami "Your robe is ready, sir sorceror."
    takeru "Don't you start. Did you really have to have that ready?"
    hagami "There are other things to prepare."
    "Hagami starts taking books off a shelf in the back."
    "By now I can read her well enough to tell if she's joking. And by my estimation Hagami's likely to burst out laughing in under thirty seconds. I'll get you back for this, Hagami."
    mana "Hagami and I were talking, and I think..."
    takeru "Oh yeah?"
    "I'm still searing at the formless sack of a robe in front me, mourning my fate."
    mana "We were thinking you could be the master of ceremonies tonight."
    takeru "The what? You expect me to have any idea what I'm doing?"
    "Hagami returns with a stack of books. Most are pretty hefty, mostly references and textbooks."
    hagami "The wheel of samsara has spun and you are now a lowly highschool student in this life, but we believe you were a powerful warlock in a past life."
    mana "Yeah! It should come naturally."
    takeru "Naturally? Look, the only thing that's ever come naturally to me is throwing a ball really fast, so unless you think in a past life I was - "
    mana "I'll help you out. Hagami, where's the ritual book?"
    "I check the pile of books Hagami brought over. They all seem occult-y enough to me, but... The old world spirit guide is in there. Plus a few titles like \"Life After Death: Thirty Hypotheses from Experts on World Religions\" and \"Existentialism and Dreams in our Twilight Years.\""
    "Not quite as kooky as I'd have thought. There's some philosophy, plus some books that look like they might be sold to the family of terminally ill elderly or something like that. Guides to grieving."
    "If I knew where to find this stuff, it's what I'd be looking for if I was trying to help Hikari."
    "Of course, Hagami picks the most dubious book of the lot and pushes it towards me. The thing is leatherbound and the title looks like someone tried to pen out the logo of a death metal band in cursive."
    hagami "Page 43."
    takeru "What even is this? Latin?"
    mana "It's almost time! From today's date, sunset should be in exactly two minutes! Hagami, grab the candles."
    takeru "Please no incense. I almost died last time."
    mana "Awwww."
    mana "One minutes to go! I'll get the candles set up. You start reading!"
    takeru "Me?"
    "I look to Hagami for help. She's trying so hard not to smile her mouth is a straight line from cheek to cheek."
    takeru "What..."
    hagami "Page 43."
    takeru "This is..."
    mana "Hurry!"
    takeru "V-veritas cogito..."
    mana "I can't hear."
    takeru "Cogito ergo..."
    "There's twelve lines here. Only twelve lines."
    "Suffer through this Takeru."
    "You've seen worse."
    "What is Mana even expecting, anyway?"
    "If the spirits of the damned don't burst through the library table, is she going to be disappointed?"
    takeru "...i-in deo speramus..."
    "Two lines left."
    "And finally."
    takeru "...deus ex!"
    "I slam the awful book shut."
    "But I'm met with an even more powerful slam."
    "The door is open, seemingly open by an inhuman force. The candles Mana placed all waver the draft."
    "Beyond the door stands a figure. Ghostly. Grim."
    hikari "Hello, supernatural club."
    hagami "Hello."
    takeru "Oh please."
    mana "Wh-wh-wh..."
    "Hikari takes a seat at the table while Mana's eyes practically bulge out of her head. I give Hikari an exasperrated look but she has her eyes closed in an attempt to look mysterious. Hagami, of course, doesn't react."
    hikari "My name's Hikari. I'm your fourth club member."
    mana "Y-y-you must be... A ghost?"
    hikari "As much it pains me to tell this to you... Yes. It looks that way."
    hagami "Hello, Hikari."
    hikari "Hi Hagami."
    "That gets a reaction. Two eyebrows from Hagami."
    mana "Y-y-you know our names?"
    hikari "You're Mana. I know more, too. You once stole a chess set out of the tea room in the old wing."
    mana "You're amazing! You can see the past? Do you do fortunes too?"
    hikari "Oh I don't know. This is less amusing than I thought it would be actually."
    hagami "Welcome. I'm sure you'll fit in here."
    hikari "Doubtful."
    mana "I was kind of hoping for a boy ghost, but..."
    mana "It's very nice to meet you, Hikari!"
    "I can't look. No matter how far I bury my face in my hands I know Hikari will never let me forget it."
    hikari "What's the schedule for tonight's meeting? Or were you really trying to summon enough students to have a legitimate club?"
    hagami "Hikari, we're here to help."
    hikari "I've heard, but..."
    "Hagami pushes her stack of books towards the center of the table. Hikari examines them. Dubiously."
    hikari "Takeru said you were the expert, but..."
    hagami "It's the only way I know how to help, so..."
    mana "Someone fill me in."
    hikari "I told you I might as well be a ghost, right?"
    mana "Y-yes, it's very exciting."
    hikari "My memory isn't working right. I'm forgetting bits and pieces of other people."
    hikari "Even I don't know what quite went wrong with me. Maybe I shouldn't be here."
    hikari "But if I'm still a student at Mirako, somehow, then I don't want to forget who I was. I want to find out what's causing me to lose that."
    hagami "We need to find something or somebody in the literature that looks like Hikari. That's all I can think of."
    takeru "Huh. You're serious."
    hagami "I never joke."
    hagami "We're not some research group. We're a bunch of students that meet in a weird old library. Let's use the resources we have."
    mana "Yeah! In all these books Hagami's got, we'll definitely find it! Some ghost memory eating demon, or an angel sent back to claim the spirits of the dead, or..."
    hagami "There's a lot to go through. Most of these books aren't worth anything, but some are serious. And, Hikari, you're here with us, aren't you?"
    hikari "Yes."
    hagami "Then we're sure to find something. You're a friend of my friend. I owe it to Takeru so I owe it to you. Welcome to the supernatural club, and we'll find a cure."
    hikari "I..."
    hikari "Actually I'm not quite sure what to say. Takeru, can you get me a book? And open up to the index or something?"
    hikari "I was not expecting much from Mirako's crack ghost hunting union or whatever you idiots had on the paper..."
    mana "That was me! You like the name?"
    hikari "No. It's imbecilic. But you people could be a lot worse. Thank you for your help, and..."
    hikari "I'm ashamed, to be hoenst. I came here to mock you, if I'm honest, and now..."
    hikari "Actually I'm overwhelmed."
    takeru "I told you to count on Hagami, right?"
    hikari "Can't deny it..."
    hikari "Takeru, can you flip the page? I'm even more useless than I remember."
    hikari "And thank you call again. Hopefully I can find a way to make it up to you."
    hagami "Don't worry. Please."
    mana "I-if you really mean that..."
    mana "I'm sorry, I'm really curious! Are you a second year? What class are you in? And where did you learn fortune telling?"
    hikari "You... Well..."
    hikari "I guess I'm in my second year. Hard to tell, isn't it? And it's not fortune telling. I've met you before, you just..."
    "Hagami pushes over a copy of \"Ontology, Identity, and Modality: Essays in Metaphysics.\" We make eye contact. Seems earnest enough to me. I open to the table of contents."
    "Hikari's book remains open to the second page of the index. Mana hardly opens hers either. They keep chatting, but mostly it seems to be Hikari dodging around Mana's questions."
    "No, there wasn't really any bright light. No, palms lines aren't important probably. No, no ghost boys (as far as she knows, don't give up hope)."
    "Hagami reads, though. She's gone through at least ten volumes of occult, philosophy, metaphysics, and ghost tales tonight. I struggle to page through the indices and chapter headings of maybe four."
    "Her expression is different though. Hagami has a gritted smile. Over on the other side of the table, I notice Hikari doesn't look so grim either."
    "The candles are out before long and in the dusk, I hit the lights. But we keep rummaging through the books. Hagami brings over another stack, but this pile she goes through herself."
    "I poke my head out of a hardcover on south Asian folklore and notice that at some point, Hikari slipped away."
    mana "I'm so..."
    "She yawns."
    mana "Too tired..."
    hagami "There's always tomorrow."
    takeru "True. Thanks a million for helping on this one. I really wouldn't know where to start by myself."
    hagami "It's a coincidence. A good one."
    mana "It's all very cloudy... We were looking for something on memory ghosts? Something... Angels?"
    mana "I'm really glad to meet our fourth member though. She's very nice... I think?"
    mana "She said she was... First year? That's not right..."
    hagami "It's alright."
    takeru "Funny, isn't it..."
    takeru "What was her name, Mana?"
    mana "Oh, I'm always so good with names, and now I... Ahh this is frustrating!"
    takeru "Maybe it won't be such a problem."
    mana "I just need to sleep. I'll see you guys tomorrow?"
    hagami "Yes."
    takeru "I'm not going anywhere, I hope."
    mana "Goodnight Hagami! Goodnight Takeru!"
    takeru "See you."
    "Mana closes the door behind her."
    "I rise to leave, then notice Hagami waiting by the exit."
    hagami "Did you forget?"
    takeru "Her name? No, that's why I - "
    hagami "Your robes."
    takeru "Oh. Seriously?"
    "No way I've been wearing these all night. No way that happened."
    "After I take off that formless red sack I definitely didn't wear all evening, I join Hikari on the walk to the door."
    "As usual, it's in silence."
    "We pass the doors out into the night air. Colder than I remember."
    "Then comes the gate. Hagami turns. She must be headed the opposite way."
    takeru "Good night."
    hagami "Hikari."
    takeru "Wait, hang on..."
    hagami "That's right, isn't it?"
    takeru "I thought..."
    takeru "Yeah. Right. You got it."
    hagami "I'll find something. We can help her, so don't worry."
    takeru "Okay. Sorry, I don't know why that caught me..."
    takeru "Yeah, thanks Hagami. I don't say it enough. You help me out, you help her out..."
    hagami "You do the same for me."
    takeru "It's... Really..."
    hagami "I thought it'd take years to find anyone even close to Mana, but..."
    hagami "I'm performing at the festival on Saturday. Save the date. Thank you and goodnight."
    takeru "See you later, Hagami."
    "She fades into the night."
    "Fifty feet away, I swear she looks back. But she just smiles."

label day13:
    
    kenta "...and if I can't decide before tomorrow, there's no time to set up, so..."
    takeru "Kenta."
    kenta "...do you think people will mind? I mean you love them, yes, but that doesn't mean.."
    takeru "Kenta."
    kenta "...tough call, so I want to take my time and not..."
    takeru "Kenta, slow down. This isn't that hard."
    "Kenta doesn't stop talking, he just stops walking and stands in the middle of the road."
    "We'll have plenty of time to get to school regardless. There's still hardly anyone around to witness Kenta arguing with himself and me alternately grumbling and nursing the bruises on my forehead. I did not wake up fast enough today."
    kenta "...of course, I always think better standing in one place, that's a very helpful..."
    takeru "Kenta I don't even know what you're talking about half the time."
    kenta "...can't really understand, but no one else has an opinion, so..."
    "Forgive me Kenta."
    takeru "Kenta, we're late!"
    kenta "What?"
    takeru "About time."
    kenta "Time? What time? My watch says - "
    takeru "Sorry, I just needed to wake you up."
    kenta "I'm perfectly awake, I think it was you who was having problems getting up in the - "
    takeru "We're not late."
    takeru "Just take a deep breath and start from the beginning. What's this about the festival?"
    "We start walking again."
    kenta "It's not about the festival, just my display in particular."
    takeru "You're performing?"
    kenta "Never. I have some space in the gym to show some of my work. We're encouraged to put our hobbies out there by the school. It's good for our image. You know there are a lot of junior high kids that come out maybe looking at attending Mirako next year."
    kenta "But do you really think they want to see my embalmed animals?"
    takeru "I'd recommend showing off your moths or something, but I seem to remember carting them in two dozen boxes down to Mirako."
    kenta "Well I can't just not display anything. I think I'll set up with the frogs."
    takeru "Sounds good to me. If I can put up with them for this long, all of those prospective students can enjoy them for a few hours at the festival."
    kenta "Right you are. You always act angry about embalming but I know you have a soft spot for animals."
    takeru "Usually when people say that they're talking about live animals, Kenta."
    takeru "Although that horned toad is growing on me."
    kenta "I'll have to bring up all the jars tomorrow then."
    kenta "I said, I'll have to bring up all the - "
    takeru "Nope. Not touching the dead stuff."
    kenta "Disappointing. And I need to find time to put together that display case..."
    takeru "What?"
    kenta "You don't just lay out preserved frogs on a desk. This is natural history, not a middle school science lab."
    takeru "I could probably help with whatever you're putting together for it, but I'm swamped myself."
    kenta "Alright. Have a good day, then."
    "We pass through the Mirako gates."
    "I wasn't kidding about being busy. Classes are a little lighter this week with the big day on Saturday, but I've still got makeup work to do, Hagami wants to hold another research session after school, and who knows what else Meiko needs done."
    
    "Everything at Mirako is a little livelier than I was expecting. A bunch of students are here early, mostly moving in and out of the gym, and it looks the setup is starting to pick up outside as well."
    "Two days to go..."
    "I'm headed for homeroom when I hear my name."
    natsumi "Takeru! Hey."
    takeru "Natsumi?"
    "She waves, then smiles sideways."
    natsumi "Weren't expecting to see me?"
    takeru "Hi. Er, you did say you weren't going to be back until Friday at the earliest, maybe not even for the first half of the festival..."
    natsumi "Guess you can tell we didn't do so hot, huh?"
    takeru "Oh. Right."
    natsumi "At least I'm here and can enjoy the festival with you all. But uhh, that's about the only upshot."
    takeru "Sorry to hear it."
    "She makes a sour face so I drop it."
    takeru "I'll just be glad you're back then."
    natsumi "Yeah, I guess my fans missed me."
    "I sit down while Natsumi sighs, stretches, then slumps into her desk."
    "Meiko's already here, of course, paging through a stack of paper."
    natsumi "Hey again, Meiko."
    meiko "I was wondering where you'd wandered off to."
    natsumi "Even if there's no practice this morning, I've got to do something outside. Even just jog."
    natsumi "Did you get any more work done on your... festival thing?"
    meiko "Not really."
    takeru "Hey Meiko."
    meiko "Good morning."
    takeru "Don't tell me you've got a show or something at the festival too."
    meiko "No, not really. Natsumi just saw me in the gym this morning and got the wrong idea."
    natsumi "She's got space booked. Don't believe her."
    meiko "I've just booked it. It's not space for me, per se."
    natsumi "But you won't tell me what you're doing with it."
    takeru "If you need help setting something up, I think I'm going to end up Kenta building something or other tomorrow, so let me - "
    meiko "I can take care of this. It's all under control."
    takeru "Right."
    "With all this work stacking up, I might as well try to review now. I should at least have everything together for first class, right?"
    "While I'm trying to find my place in my math textbook, I overhear Natsumi and Meiko."
    natsumi "...I mean even by the fifth inning everything was blowing up."
    natsumi "I thought we could at least make it to the knockout rounds."
    natsumi "How the hell am I supposed to run practice today? I just want to - "
    meiko "You'll do fine. You always have. Your team respects you."
    natsumi "Easy for you to say. You've never screwed up like this before. I didn't even know these things had a mercy rule."
    meiko "For one, it's not your fault alone. And I don't always make the right call either."
    natsumi "Yeah, it's not like I'm the only one who bombed, but no one else got ejected from the game though."
    natsumi "Why can't I be cool, calm, and stoic all the time..."
    meiko "I'm not sure that would too healthy."
    natsumi "Oh come on. You pull it off just fine."
    "Natsumi flops onto her desk and Meiko starts patting her back."
    meiko "Your team probably admires you for it. And they'll admire you more if you tell them to keep their heads up, enjoy the festival, and do better next time."
    natsumi "Blech. Yeah I won't beat myself up. I guess. Man, we were going to get back late on Saturday, and then there'd be victory fireworks at the festival..."
    natsumi "I had this all planned. Dammit."
    meiko "Next year for sure."
    "Meiko stands up to perform her class rep duties, and with a sigh, Natsumi goes back to pressing her face into her desk."
    natsumi "Yeah, laugh all you want, Takeru."
    takeru "What?"
    natsumi "Oh you're not even looking at me. You're watching Natsumi. Great."
    takeru "I thought I was supposed to not be laughing at you."
    natsumi "Yes but you're also supposed to have some sympathy. Meiko's probably way better at it but you could at least flatter me."
    takeru "I don't get you at all."
    natsumi "Never had anyone tell me that before. Maybe you can be flattering after all."
    takeru "Still not getting it."
    "Natsumi makes a face then sits back up."
    "Looks like it's time for class. I never did finish putting my notes together. It's going to be a rough couple hours until lunch."
    
    
    "As usual, the room clears quickly at lunch, and I make for the old wing."
    "There's no one down here today, despite all the festival activity unfolding. That suits me fine."
    "But as I walk down the hall, I feel like I'm not alone. Hikari?"
    "No. It's a sound. Muffled, like Hagami's radio."
    "It can't be her, can it? I stop outside the piano room, but I don't hear the noise any more. She must not be there."
    "I take one step up the stairs then - it's back. I'm not just hearing things, am I?"
    "Back the piano room. I can't hear anything outside, but..."
    hagami "Takeru?"
    "A voice inside."
    takeru "What? How'd you know it was me."
    hagami "You're lurking around."
    hagami "It was a guess, anyway."
    takeru "I was just headed upstairs to the library. I guess you're going to practice?"
    "She rises from the piano chair. Oddly enough I don't spot any sheet music."
    hagami "No. It's not..."
    hagami "Let's eat. If I start in again you'll probably hide out there to listen."
    takeru "Oh come on. I didn't peek at that performance application, right?"
    hagami "Fair."
    hagami "This is more important though."
    takeru "Isn't it the same thing?"
    "She shakes her head."
    takeru "Well, let's just go to the library."
    hagami "Mm."
    takeru "Thanks for being kind to Hikari last night. I know with people like that you're usually, er..."
    hagami "Quiet?"
    takeru "Yeah."
    hagami "Then... That did happen."
    takeru "What do you mean? Hikari really showed up? Of course she did. Don't worry, you didn't inhale too much incense or something and dream her up."
    hagami "That makes things a little..."
    hagami "Who is she?"
    "Hagami stops right outside the library door to pose the question."
    takeru "A friend of mine? I'm not sure what you mean. I wasn't making up the whole ghost part. Or the memory part."
    hagami "Then... Who was she?"
    takeru "A student here. I don't know much about it, but something happened at the festival, and then she..."
    takeru "Shouldn't you know this?"
    hagami "I transferred."
    takeru "Right... And Mana's a first year. Huh."
    takeru "That's pretty much all I know, though."
    hagami "It might be good to know. To know more of it. For the research."
    takeru "Feel free to ask."
    hagami "..."
    takeru "You were doing fine night."
    hagami "Maybe I was carried away. It... It seems something strange is happening at Mirako."
    takeru "Search me what it is though. Anyway, I'm starving."
    
    "When we enter the room, I'm surprised to see two faces at the table."
    "Mana sits with her lunch untouched in front of her, talking away at the serenely listening Hikari in front of her."
    mana "...and a year ago I thought I had all this mystic stuff down, but you're really an expert. You'll have to teach me how you - "
    mana "Hey Hagami! Hey Takeru! The gang's all here!"
    "Some gang. Hikari nods at me, and Hagami flicks on the radio."
    mana "So I have to help the swim team set up tonight, but I should be around for a little while anyway. I wouldn't want to let a fellow supernatural club member down."
    hikari "I'm honored."
    mana "Hagami do you play chess?"
    hagami "No."
    mana "Takeru?"
    takeru "Er, not very well, only what I've - "
    mana "Did you know Hikari's an expert? She was showing me this chess set, apparently..."
    "Mana seems to be mostly talking to Hagami so I snag the chance to eat in peace."
    hikari "Takeru."
    takeru "Hey. Didn't expect to see you here."
    hikari "Where did you find that girl?"
    takeru "Don't give me that. If you were showing her those hand-carved pieces of yours, you can't dislike her that much."
    hikari "Hmph."
    hikari "She's very wound up. Did you market me as a mysterious upperclassman witch? She was even pitching a magic show for the festival."
    takeru "Right, keep me away from that."
    hikari "Me too."
    takeru "Hey, careful you don't get pushed into it. They might need to start filling festival performance time if there's no fireworks this year."
    hikari "That's true then?"
    takeru "That the fireworks are off? Yeah."
    hikari "I heard it from... that girl... but I didn't believe it. That's the highlight of the festival. That's Mirako at it's best. And that old story... If you see the fireworks reflected in the eyes of your beloved..."
    takeru "I didn't know you went in for that romantic stuff."
    hikari "Oh don't call it that. You make it sound cheap. All year the little moments come together, the details, then at the very end..."
    "She taps two fingers on the table, noiselessly."
    hikari "Fireworks. It's symbolic."
    takeru "Literature isn't really one of my better subjects."
    hikari "Unsurprising. I should teach you a thing or two about good books when I have the chance."
    hikari "Why are they canceled anyway?"
    takeru "Er, it's kind of complicated..."
    takeru "But I think it has something to do with what happened last year? You know, that whole thing where you..."
    hikari "That's ridiculous."
    takeru "It's only what I heard from Meiko."
    hikari "Hm, and she's in charge this year, isn't she?"
    hikari "If I make it through this, remind me to look into what's happening in the festival planning committee."
    takeru "Wait, 'make it through...' You're not going anywhere are you?"
    hikari "Not now."
    takeru "I thought you were just... It was little stuff, right? Are you that sick? What..."
    mana "Takeru. Takeru!"
    takeru "What's up?"
    mana "You were sort of zoned out. You're coming tonight, right?"
    takeru "Right. More research. Yeah I'll be there."
    "After establishing that, Mana goes back to grilling Hikari. For once it's Mana's lunch that goes untouched."
    "I just watch with Hagami. She puts down one book and opens another, this one some treatise on Brazilian black magic. Guess Hagami never takes a break."
    "Actually, when is she finding the time to practice for her recital? There's two days to go, and she was up with us looking through books last night, and will be again tonight..."
    "I hope introducing Hikari wasn't asking too much."
    
    "Classes wrap up for the day. I think I'm finally getting back on track."
    "Well, at least it's looking like I won't have to spend the festival weekend at a desk somewhere doing homework. That's all I can ask for."
    "Natsumi, though... I can't tell if she's alive or dead for most of the afternoon. She's comatose."
    "Not even the final bell gets her up. She sits there with her head propped on her elbows."
    meiko "Natsumi. Natsumi, time to go."
    natsumi "Oh, what now? Hm? Let me be, it's not like I've got anywhere to go..."
    meiko "Will you still be around Mirako in a few hours? Practicing, maybe?"
    natsumi "Heh, practicing? No way. I'm leaving as soon as I have the energy to get up. One hour, tops."
    meiko "That's too bad, we could've walked home. Find me if you need me."
    "I catch Meiko by the door, away from Natsumi."
    takeru "Er, Meiko..."
    meiko "Hey."
    takeru "I was just wandering if, er..."
    takeru "If there's anything I can do to help with the festival, let me know. You seem busy all the time so - "
    meiko "I'm busy because there's a lot to be done, but it's all under control. We can't afford to let anything slip in the last couple days. Thanks for the offer though."
    meiko "I'd stay for a bit but there's a meeting in an hour and I have a few things I want to get done first. See you Takeru."
    takeru "Bye."
    "As Meiko leaves, Natsumi laughs at me from across the room."
    takeru "What? You told me to keep an eye on her, right? Something like that?"
    natsumi "Maybe you took me too literally. No, you do what you want."
    takeru "Yeah I don't get it."
    takeru "I've got better things to do. Are you really going to keep sitting here? The tournament wasn't that bad, was it?"
    natsumi "I was planning on sobbing into my desk, actually."
    takeru "Seriously?"
    natsumi "No, you dope. I'm headed home."
    takeru "See you later, then."
    "We say goodbye in the hall, and decide to head to the old wing."
    "Hagami and Mana and I never really had a set time to meet tonight, but I don't have much else to do."
    "But when I reach the library, the door is closed and the lights are out. Don't tell me they were going to show up at twilight again?"
    "Maybe I'll just find Hikari. I head back downstairs and work backwards."
    "I tiptoe around the piano room, but doesn't sound like anyone's there."
    "The tearoom door is open. That's unusual. But I see a girl standing by the window."
    takeru "Hey Hi - "
    meiko "Takeru?"
    takeru "Meiko? What the - "
    takeru "You scared the hell out of me."
    meiko "You're the one who walked in, aren't you?"
    takeru "The door was open."
    meiko "Weren't you looking for me?"
    takeru "Er... Not really."
    meiko "Well."
    "I notice Hikari's newly-carved chess pieces are scattered on the table."
    meiko "What are you doing down here then?"
    takeru "Me? I'm down here all the time. What are you here for?"
    meiko "It's... complicated."
    meiko "I'm surprised you would ever come down here at all. Most students pretend this wing doesn't exist. It is a little gloomy."
    meiko "But if you're being honest... Have you seen a chess set around here?"
    takeru "Isn't there one on the table? What do you need chess pieces for?"
    meiko "No just any pieces... The set I'm thinking of is different. It's hand-painted, green and orange."
    takeru "What..."
    "Hikari's set?"
    meiko "I didn't think so. Oh well."
    "She seats herself by the table and remains silent. I might as well sit down as well."
    meiko "I could've sworn it was in here. It belongs to a friend of mine. You don't know her."
    takeru "Can you tell me what you're up? I might be able to help. Really. Maybe I know - "
    meiko "You. Don't. Know her."
    meiko "Takeru I'm glad you're eager to help, but I'm fine, and I can do this on my own. It has to be done right, so it's got to be me to do it. You..."
    takeru "Sorry."
    "For a moment there she slipped into the monotone I remember that day from the Cat's Corner Cafe. But Meiko takes a breath and collects herself."
    meiko "No, I should apologize if I lost my temper for a second. If I've said anything strange the past few days, it's just because I'm been spending too much time on the festival."
    meiko "I'll see you later."
    "The door shuts behind her. I'm left staring at the new, unpainted pieces lined up on the table."
    "They're all set up for a new game. Did Meiko do this? Did Hikari? Why does everyone seem so interested in that one chess set?"
    "I half expect Hikari to emerge from a corner somewhere and laugh at me, but the only company is the shadows that lengthen as the sun sets in the sky."
    "I try a few problems from the back of my math book but can't get anything done. Probably Meiko's at her meeting now. Or setting up her own festival display. Or overseeing the preperations out by the fields."
    "Last Sunday, when we went into town to fetch the grill..."
    "For a moment that day she seemed mortal, just another confused and overworked student like me. She said that much, didn't she?"
    "Two days and the festival will all be over. She'll be fine. Right?"
    
    "After about an hour in the tearoom, it's obvious Hikari's out somewhere else. I've never quite figured out what she does or where she goes for half the day, when she's not busy popping into my classes."
    "Rather than waiting around, I pack up my things and head for the library."
    "It doesn't sound like anyone's in there but the light is on. When I push open the door, Mana is putting books on the shelf from a stack in her arms."
    takeru "Hey Mana."
    mana "Takeru! You made it."
    takeru "It wasn't exactly a hard trip. What're you up to?"
    mana "Reshelving. I don't know what else to do so I might as well help out by picking up a little."
    mana "Hikari reads twice as fast as me but she never puts anything away..."
    takeru "I'm pretty sure you could build a pyramid out of loose books and seal her in there, and she'd be happy about it."
    "Mana laughs then joins me at the table."
    mana "Maybe."
    mana "I've been running around all week trying to help the swim team with their fundraiser, but I wonder what Hagami's been up to..."
    mana "Normally she'd be in here all day but sometimes when I show up there's a clean table."
    takeru "I wonder..."
    mana "She doesn't keep secrets, you know. We've been best friends for a long time."
    mana "Although I don't think we've ever been in a real club together. It is kind of nice being official. Thanks for getting that started, Takeru! You're the best new member the club could ask for."
    mana "And you even volunteered for the initiation rite!"
    takeru "Pretty sure I didn't."
    mana "Close enough."
    takeru "Why doesn't Hikari have to go through that? It's only fair, right?"
    mana "Who?"
    "I must look stupid, staring at Mana like this, but it feels like I just walked straight into a wall."
    mana "Sorry? Maybe I heard you wrong."
    "Then the door flies open. On its own?"
    hikari "Hello, supernatural club."
    mana "Wh-wh-wh..."
    hikari "I'm Hikari."
    mana "Y-you know my question before I ask! Then - "
    hikari "Yes, I'm also a ghost. I'm your fourth member."
    mana "That's amazing! Can you - "
    hikari "Your name's Mana, you're a first year student here, and right now you're slightly disappoined that I'm a girl."
    "Whatever dopey face I was making earlier is nothing compared to Mana now. She looks like a child that just woke up and realized it's their birthday. I don't remember ever seeing her speechless."
    "Hikari, for her part, seems nonplussed. She sits at the table next to me, and we wait a few seconds, watching Mana for any signs that she's remembered how to speak."
    takeru "What the... What did you do, Hikari?"
    hikari "It's not that impressive. Kind of sad, really."
    hikari "She never remembers who I am, exactly. When I showed up at lunch she did this exact same thing. Those exact questions."
    hikari "Mana, you're on volume ten of Aquamarine Heaven's Saints. Your favorite character is Yuji but you wish he was a ghost."
    "Mana's eyes continue to bulge out of her head."
    takeru "That seems unfair, Hikari."
    hikari "If I'm going to have to introduce myself every single time I meet her, I will do it my way. Alright?"
    takeru "If she faints, we're one member down for our research. We're here trying to figure out what's wrong with you, remember?"
    hikari "Fair."
    hikari "Mana. Hello? Mana."
    mana "H-hello Hikari."
    hikari "I'd like to get started. There were a couple books here at lunch. Do you know where they went?"
    mana "Books? Oh, you said research, right. We're trying to figure out why... Okay, okay, I remember! Wait, why are we..."
    hikari "Or do you know where Hagami is? That might be easier."
    takeru "We can still start without her. I think we were going through that encyclopedia set, right? The world religion one?"
    hikari "That sounds correct."
    takeru "I'll get it. When Hagami shows up she'll probably have a better idea of what to do."
    
    "It's almost an hour before Hagami arrives."
    "The encyclopedia we're supposed to be going through is mind-numbing. It's a translation from the original Chinese, apparently, and with only the vaguest idea of what to look for, it isn't helpful."
    "There are plenty of accounts of souls of the damned rising up to attack villages in ancient Mongolia, but nothing that really sounds like Hikari."
    "Hikari, for her part, is also trying to read, but she has to count on Mana to turn the pages, and Mana seems more interested in talking at Hikari than dealing with books."
    "I'm watching Hikari gesturing at Mana for her to flip the page for a solid twenty seconds when Hagami slips in. She doesn't say her hellos, just takes a seat at the table. She looks almost pale."
    takeru "Hey, it's Hagami."
    hikari "Hello."
    mana "Hagami! You'll never guess who - "
    hagami "Hello. Hi, Hikari."
    "Hagami immediately begins sorting through stacks of the books on the table. Hikari and Mana go back to their encyclopedia volume."
    "I look from Hagami, then back to Mana and Hikari."
    "Hagami definitely knew Hikari's name. She greeted her. And she knows we're here to help Hikari, right? That's why she just got up for more books."
    "But Mana had no idea who Hikari even was, despite talking to her earlier today."
    "There are still too many things I don't understand."
    "Hagami sits back down next to me with a stack of bound and laminated papers, fresh from the shelves. It looks like a bunch of doctoral theses. I'd probably need a doctorate to parse any of it."
    hagami "They're funny, aren't they?"
    "She whispers."
    takeru "Mana and Hikari? You're not jealous are you?"
    hagami "No. It's seeing her with someone who isn't me or on the swim team."
    takeru "Hikari's a bit of a questionable friend..."
    hagami "Are they making much progress?"
    takeru "I doubt it. I've tried to get through that encyclopedia set you found, but..."
    hagami "There's nothing there. I checked last night."
    takeru "Guess I wasted the past hour then... Where were you anyway?"
    hagami "..."
    "She glances away."
    takeru "Sorry."
    hagami "Downstairs."
    takeru "I should've known that. The practice is going well?"
    hagami "..."
    hagami "Let's focus on Hikari."
    "She hands me the top binder off the stack and turns to face a wall."
    "Does that mean... not well?"
    "The paper I'm tasked with is a couple dozen typewritten pages and bound in transparent plastic. Printed at the top is \"Refuting Kant: The False Subtlety of the Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics.\" I have no idea how this could ever be related to Hikari."
    "The Hikari/Mana team starts working through the papers as well. By the time I'm finished (and befuddled by) the future of metaphysics, Hagami's already cut the stack in half."
    "Next up is some vaguely blasphemous take on the Judeo-Christian afterlife by someone with a very shoddy understanding of where to put paragraph breaks. There's nothing in here either but a waste of a half hour of my life."
    "Somewhere during the evening, the radio turned on. It's back to that tinny symphony. I wonder what happened to the piano/cello CDs from Hagami's parents?"
    "Hagami works in silence. The only chatter is Mana and Hikari. Then eventually even that falls quiet."
    "Then I notice why."
    hikari "Mana. Psst."
    hikari "Mana!"
    "She's asleep on top of one of the papers, her cheek flattened against the plastic cover."
    "Eventually Hagami taps her on the shoulder."
    hagami "Mana. Go home."
    mana "Whazzat?"
    hikari "I would've left you but you started drooling on the Summa Theologiae."
    mana "Oh sorry!"
    hagami "Were you up late?"
    mana "Studying. And more to do tonight! If I flunk out I can't be in any clubs."
    hikari "Mana, I appreciate your taking the time to help me, but..."
    hikari "You don't need to push yourself that much."
    takeru "Don't get sick again."
    mana "Yep, I won't. I'm doing my best."
    hagami "See you tomorrow."
    mana "Huh? I was going to - "
    hagami "Bye. Get some sleep."
    mana "I'm not - "
    "This time she cuts herself off with a huge yawn."
    mana "I get it."
    mana "See you all tomorrow everyone! Hikari, you should come with us for lunch!"
    hikari "...and introduce myself again? Ugh, if there's nothing else..."
    mana "What's that?"
    hikari "I'll try to be there."
    takeru "Goodnight."
    
    "With Mana gone for the night, it's a little tougher for Hikari to read. Hagami and I turn pages from time to time, but most of work is paging through indexes and chapter headings, it's not much help."
    "Finally she seems to give up and just listen to the radio."
    "Or maybe she's only fidgeting."
    hikari "I hate being so useless."
    takeru "Er, sorry. If you need a page, I can - "
    hikari "Not that, even. How does it turn out that I can't even figure out what exactly I am, let alone what's wrong with me, and have to relay on all of you for the most basic tasks in the world?"
    hagami "I don't mind."
    hikari "You might not mind but I sure feel guilty. I forgot how to deal with people after being cooped up in that tea room for so long. Maybe I should've just stayed down there and saved you the trouble."
    hagami "You can help."
    hikari "How?"
    hagami "We're sort of..."
    hagami "We're in the dark. It's hard to tell what... what you are."
    hikari "And you expect me to know? If I knew that I wouldn't be up here all night."
    hagami "No, I mean..."
    hagami "I don't know you."
    hikari "Well of course not. You transferred. I didn't know your name until a week ago, and I've forgotten it twice since then."
    "Hagami looks like she's about to speak, thinks better of it, then turns to me and mumbles."
    hagami "At lunch, when I asked you what you knew about her..."
    takeru "That was it. I was being honest. I'm not dancing around anything."
    hagami "Alright."
    hagami "Then, Hikari..."
    hagami "Who are you?"
    hikari "What? I'm not trying to trick you. This isn't a prank."
    hikari "I'm Hikari. My family name is... well..."
    hikari "Guess I can't even remember that any more."
    hagami "Then... Who were you? At Mirako?"
    hikari "It's not like I suddenly changed."
    hikari "Well... Maybe I did, gradually. I looked the same, had the same hobbies. Tea. Crafts. I used to read a lot, too."
    hikari "...A lot of the same things Mana's reading. I probably acted a lot more like her too. More cheerful. Not too many friends, but friendly."
    hikari "You don't really care about this do you?"
    hagami "It could be important."
    hagami "Then, a year ago, you..."
    hagami "You..."
    hikari "Oh. That."
    hikari "I died, I suppose."
    hagami "How?"
    hikari "That's what you wanted to ask this whole time, isn't it?"
    hagami "It..."
    hagami "They say people that die in accidents might stay behind on earth if they're confused or scared..."
    hagami "Murder victims might find their killer, or... Travelers look for their families. Or if someone dies before they realize their dream, maybe they..."
    hagami "Maybe they stay here to accomplish it."
    "Hagami speaks with her eyes closed, but, even so, I don't think I've ever heard her say that much at once before."
    hikari "That's what you want, then?"
    hikari "The school caught fire. Not sure they ever figured out why. I thought it was a lantern."
    hikari "Some students went in to put it out so they wouldn't get in trouble. When the fire went out of control, I went in to get those fools out."
    hikari "Joke's on me I guess though. I died in the hospital a few weeks later. And it's not like I saved anyone either. Kind of pathetic."
    takeru "That sounds heroic."
    hikari "I was always sickly. I don't what I thought would happen, running in there. Not my brightest moment."
    hagami "And your... regrets?"
    hikari "Regrets? I regret getting myself killed."
    hagami "You don't hold it against - "
    hikari "No, I don't blame anyone who went in to fight the fire. They thought they'd be heroic and save the school, and I thought I'd be heroic and save my friends. Same bad decision."
    hagami "Then... What did you want?"
    hikari "Well I'd have wanted to be alive, obviously."
    hagami "I mean when you were alive. What did you want?"
    hikari "Oh. Well... Um."
    "Hikari's always precise with her language so out of context, it'd almost be funny to see her at a loss for words."
    hikari "It's hard to say, isn't it?"
    hikari "I never wanted to come to Mirako. My parents pushed my into it. Back then what I wanted, I guess..."
    hikari "I just wanted an average high school life. That was my ideal. None of that bickering, constantly switching schools in junior high, knowing nobody."
    hikari "Mirako was alright. I had a few friends, even some good ones. Nothing was easy. Nothing with people is easy, they always have their quirks. But it wasn't bad. More than anything I just wanted to enjoy the night and watch the fireworks with my friends."
    hikari "You can laugh if you like, but that's it. I don't think I forgot anything. I didn't think it was too much to ask. Apparently it was, because now I'm dead and somehow dying a second time."
    hagami "...Thank you."
    takeru "That sounds pretty harsh."
    hikari "It's not great. It's been down hill from there. When no one could recognize me or remember me..."
    hikari "Honestly Takeru if you hadn't wandered into me I'd probably still be in that tea room."
    hikari "I'm not sure if that narrows things down or not, Hagami. I should've introduced myself more thoroughly. It can be painful sometimes so I try to avoid it."
    hagami "I understand. Don't worry."
    hagami "Though... It does give me an idea."
    hagami "We might be looking in the wrong direction."
    takeru "What do you mean?"
    hagami "Studies, textbooks, all that... Maybe instead..."
    hagami "I don't know. I'll think. Tomorrow we'll see."
    takeru "You want to call it a night?"
    hagami "I'll practice. Or maybe..."
    hagami "Yes. You should go home."
    takeru "I should get my homework out of the way for the festival. Wouldn't want to be busy."
    takeru "I'll be back tomorrow. We're making progress. I think. So don't give up, Hikari."
    hikari "Thank you, but I'm a born pessimist."
    takeru "See you later, Hagami."
    hagami "Goodnight."
    
    "It must be getting pretty late. The old wing is dark. Black outside, and only every other light is on in the hallway."
    "I'm trying to figure out when exactly Hagami and Hikari slipped away. I doubt Hikari's going anywhere, but should I be walking Hagami back to the dorms? It's night already."
    "Then there's a voice by my side."
    hikari "I caught up with you."
    takeru "You're the one that ran off somewhere."
    hikari "Can I walk you home?"
    takeru "Er, I'm not sure how that works. Can you even leave the school grounds?"
    hikari "We'll find out then, won't we?"
    "I won't complain."
    "When we get to the entrance I look around for Hagami, but it's hard to see much from the streetlights."
    hikari "What? Are you checking for your friend?"
    takeru "Maybe she's still inside..."
    hikari "You keep some very odd company."
    takeru "I don't need to hear that from you. You're literally some sort of supernatural anomaly."
    hikari "That's impolite."
    takeru "Besides, you seem to like Mana well enough."
    hikari "It's the other one."
    takeru "Hagami?"
    hikari "She asks some pointed questions."
    takeru "You didn't have to answer if you didn't want to. I don't think I'd even heard that story before."
    "I can't picture it. A carefree Hikari? The same bizarre taste in manga as Mana?"
    "Heroically trying to rescue her friends from a fire? Until recently I would've called her borderline antisocial."
    hikari "You never asked about those times before."
    takeru "I did, early on. When you first told me you weren't, well, alive. You got evasive so I didn't press it. Should I have? Might've saved us some time today."
    hikari "Oh I doubt I'd answer back then. I wasn't lying when I said I'd still be lurking down in that tea room if it hadn't you to stumble in."
    "We pass the gates and rejoin the main road. The banner announcing the festival trembles in the breeze. It's a temperate night, cloudy but comforting."
    hikari "I've can't remember leaving Mirako ground before. There's never been a need."
    takeru "No need? You didn't want to go home? Or talk to any of those friends of yours?"
    hikari "I tried at first. I really cared about them... I think."
    hikari "I was out sick for a while first, so nobody knew how bad it was. Once it became clear I was a lost cause, it was just taken for granted. One day I'd die. So when I did, they were all ready."
    takeru "You can't tell me no one missed you."
    hikari "They all mourned. Everyone was sad for a while. But they moved on. It's only me stuck here. Everyone else needed to get on with their life."
    hikari "And eventually they forgot me. So I found someplace to claim as my own corner of the world, and that was that."
    hikari "Now maybe it's my revenge that I forget all of them."
    hikari "Isn't revenge supposed to hurt the other person more than yourself though?"
    hikari "I have some names. A few fragments of faces now. And I remember the fire, although it's not all that pleasant."
    takeru "I wonder..."
    "Certain gears are beginning to click in my head."
    "What was Natsumi saying? Something about Meiko last year? And she was in the tea room today."
    "Something's always been off."
    takeru "Meiko was one of those friends, right? In the fire?"
    hikari "Who's that again? Maybe I knew her."
    takeru "You said you did. Meiko. My friend from forever ago, on the student council. She's putting together the festival this year."
    hikari "I know the name, I guess. Maybe I've just..."
    "She doesn't show any emotional response. Hikari just keeps walking."
    takeru "We'll figure out why - "
    takeru "Hikari?"
    "Where she was standing my by side, there's now only gentle wind."
    "I check behind. Nothing. Did she head off the road?"
    "Nothing. No one."
    "I step under a streetlight."
    "Ghosts are supposed to be frightening. \"Supernatural anomaly\" right? Hikari's always been Hikari first, ghost second, but..."
    "The hair on my nape raises. And I check my back again."
    "There's something standing under the gate. Mirako uniform cathing in the wind."
    takeru "Who..."
    takeru "Who's there?"
    hikari "Me, obviously. What're you doing running ahead?"
    takeru "Running ahead? What are you doing disappearing like that? I think that took a few years off my life."
    hikari "I have no idea what you're talking about."
    takeru "You... We were talking..."
    takeru "And then you were..."
    hikari "Flickering."
    hikari "I didn't think things were this bad... Unfortunate. Ugh."
    takeru "Then that's your memory thing?"
    hikari "It's hard for me to say, isn't it? I was going to walk with you, so - "
    takeru "Don't worry about it. Rest up, or whatever it is you do. Maybe it's something strange with Mirako, that you can't..."
    "But she walks down to join me, then takes a step further down the road."
    "Hikari turns around."
    hikari "Are you coming or not?"
    takeru "Right..."
    hikari "If that unsettled you, I'm sorry. But that's been my life this past week. One moment I'm talking to you, then I have no idea where I am."
    hikari "I'm starting to worry soon I'll be standing somewhere and then next, poof, nothing. Oblivion."
    "She laughs but it's not a joke."
    takeru "I'm sorry, I don't - "
    hikari "I don't really need pity. Your work the past couple days is more than enough already. And probably more productive."
    hikari "Before, what was I talking about, then?"
    takeru "Before your, er..."
    takeru "You were saying you knew Meiko. Back last year."
    hikari "The name doesn't ring a bell."
    takeru "Wait, I thought - "
    takeru "..."
    hikari "You're worried, aren't you Takeru?"
    takeru "Am I that easy to read?"
    hikari "A bit."
    hikari "Not that I'm not worried."
    "We walk in near silence."
    "A few leaves blow lazily under the lamplight. The night's quiet. I hear my footsteps, but nothing next to me."
    "But Hikari's still there."
    hikari "It probably won't be long."
    takeru "What?"
    hikari "That moment. I just disappear and don't turn up anywhere."
    takeru "No... What? Hagami will find something for sure. She sounded like she had a lead."
    hikari "It's all been too quick. I'm not sure what I'm doing wandering around this world in the first place. Oblivion sounds more appropriate."
    takeru "I'd rather you didn't vanish into nothing, thanks."
    hikari "Really, Takeru? That'd upset you?"
    takeru "Yeah. It's not much of a question."
    takeru "Even from that first day you were pointing me in the right direction. And when I was running into trouble with Natsumi and Meiko..."
    takeru "Yeah, I'd be upset. Don't go anywhere."
    hikari "You've got practically your whole life in front of you. I've got a week, maybe, I'd guess. Prepare for the worst and move on."
    takeru "I won't forget."
    hikari "It's easy to say now."
    takeru "I haven't so far, have I?"
    hikari "No."
    "For a second I wonder why she's standing still. Then I realize we're at the fork in the road. The dorms are right down that path. Town is the other way, completing the circle around the hill."
    "I've never been down that road at night. The next streetlight seems far, almost fifty feet. And the only lights past that are from houses down in the valley, barely visible in the foggy moonlight."
    "But we both keep walking that way anyway."
    hikari "No, you haven't forgotten about me. If your friend Hagami's so bright maybe she'll figure that one out too."
    hikari "If you're going to get all torn up if I vanish, maybe it would've been better if you'd never remembered my name."
    takeru "You'd want that?"
    hikari "Are you kidding? No. The past month or so has been..."
    hikari "I'd sound like an imbecile saying it."
    hikari "It's unfamiliar ground now. I'd never been out of that room in half a year, then, actually talking to people in the halls, class... People whose faces that'd been completely blank for me..."
    hikari "Your friends are good people, you know. I hope you keep the club together. I felt some of it."
    takeru "Some of what?"
    hikari "When I told Hagami what my dreams were a year ago, I wasn't lying. Simple things. The details. Those stupid arguments you get into on a daily basis."
    hikari "It all means something. Then... Fireworks."
    takeru "Fireworks? Like, literal fireworks?"
    hikari "Why can't it be both? I swear the symbolism is lost on you Takeru."
    hikari "That's all I wanted. That's still all I want. One year ago, I wanted to sit out in the field and watch the fireworks with my friends. That climax, to finish it all off."
    hikari "I got my big finish I guess. That's irony, Takeru, for reference."
    takeru "I get it... Sort of."
    takeru "You never struck me as the fireworks type. They're big and explosive, and you, er, play chess in a quiet room and everything."
    hikari "Maybe you still don't understand."
    hikari "Have you seen fireworks before?"
    takeru "Yeah, sure. I went to a few shows for holidays and things like that."
    hikari "Did you know anyone?"
    takeru "Just my parents, mostly."
    hikari "Did you help set up?"
    takeru "No."
    hikari "Mirako is tight-knit. You're supposed to know each other and help each other out. Last year we all ran around like headless chickens trying to set it all up. The big, explosive things don't matter if you haven't seen all the detail before it."
    hikari "I did all the setup. The payoff was just a pointless death. The end. Fin."
    hikari "I died in bed weeks later. You can't even say the fireworks were my sendoff."
    "We rest against a stone wall. It's probably a good ways back."
    "The wind picks up again. Maybe it's time to turn around."
    hikari "That's what I want, Takeru."
    takeru "What?"
    hikari "I appreciate all the work, but you can tell Hagami and what's-her-name they don't need to resarch anything about me any more."
    hikari "I'll catch the fireworks at the festival this year, then - "
    "She claps her hands. Soundlessly."
    hikari "Then I'll be gone. That's the way to go. Forget me or not, that's the way it's done. With a bang."
    takeru "There's..."
    takeru "The fireworks are off this year."
    hikari "..."
    "When the wind dies, my footsteps are again the only noise."
    "Somewhere in the distance, down in the valley, a car passes through the hills."
    hikari "Oh."
    takeru "And I don't think you're going anywhere anyway, right? Isn't that what we're all getting together in the library for?"
    hikari "It's alright."
    takeru "You'll come out to the festival at least though, right? The whole thing isn't just a fireworks show. Meiko's got something prepared, I bet, and Hagami's performing, so..."
    hikari "Yeah."
    takeru "Don't give up, Hikari."
    hikari "If only as a favor to you, Takeru."
    hikari "...We're back."
    "Back at the fork. The dorms. Home."
    takeru "Guess so. Right."
    takeru "I'll see you tomorrow."
    hikari "Goodbye."
    "Hikari raises one hand in farewell, and then I lose her in the night."

label day14:
    
    "I wake up and almost don't recognize the room."
    "There are no pickled frogs between me and my alarm clock. There's no sign of the new cabinet and its assorted amphibian contents. Even the spare boxes are gone."
    "And the strangest part: no sign of Kenta."
    "Did I slip into an alternate universe last night?"
    "Maybe last night I started sleepwalking and wandered into someone else's room. I do live here? Right?"
    "I open a drawer at random. Inside, socks aren't bunched into pairs. Instead, eight identical white socks are piled up in a stack. Next to that stack, eight identical brown socks. And eight blacks after that."
    "Nope, definitely home. This is definitely a dorm ruled by Kenta."
    "Unfortunately, with the lord and master of the laundry gone, I'll have to hunt down my clothes today."
    "But then I see a shirt and pants set out on the dresser, along with a piece of paper."
    takeru "Is this a note...?"
    takeru "Of course not."
    "It's a grid with today's date at the top and blocked out into hour chunks. It's a schedule. Looks like Kenta's penciled in some modifications."
    "Lunch and every class is labeled, then time for other work, but in the morning blocks..."
    takeru "'Festival Preparations...' And that lunatic started at 5:00 AM?"
    takeru "The school can't be open that early, he's nuts..."
    "I guess this is Kenta's way of telling me where he went."
    "Did he take the whole cabinet to Mirako? How'd he get it up the hill? Actually, how would he even get it out the door?"
    "Putting that mystery aside, I check the clock. It's still early, but there's no chance of getting back to sleep. I passed out last night, but now there's too much on my mind."
    "I throw on my clothes and get ready to leave. If I'm early, I can always check what new horrors Kenta is prepping for the festival."
    "It's a clear morning, and quiet."
    "Unfortunately with Kenta not around, all I've got for company are my own thoughts. Mostly about Hikari."
    "Last night I felt like I understood her, to a point. Why she was so closed off back then, why she seems to have such a low opinion of everyone at Mirako..."
    "But what did say about Mirako? It's a unique place. We're supposed to help each other out. Right? I understand that."
    "What I hate is that she seems so resigned to her fate."
    "Who says she's supposed to just vanish without a trace?"
    "That's pointless. She came back to see her friends forget her, lose all her memories of them, and then fade away with just as much disappointment as the day she died?"
    "Completely pointless."
    "It's anger, if I had to describe it. Not at her, but at... fate?"
    "I'm trying to do everything I can, right? Working with Hagami every night this week..."
    "We'll find some way to save her. We have to."
    "...If I showed up at school today, and she was just gone, what would I do?"
    "I think."
    "Then I realize I'm not really angry. More anxious. I'm worried I'll lose my friend."
    "It's hard to imagine someone could vanish, there one day gone the next. But it's happened to her once before, hasn't it? Almost exactly a year ago today?"
    takeru "Wait... I'm not doing absolutely everything I can, really..."
    "There are no fireworks this year. Why? No idea. But I know who's responsible."
    takeru "I'll talk to Meiko. I've got to talk to Meiko."
    "My stomach twists into a knot thinking about it. There's maybe three things wrong with that conversation: Meiko doesn't want to talk about last year's festival. She doesn't want to talk about this years fireworks. And I can't even tell if she wants to talk to me."
    "I'll do it though. Whether Hikari's the next day or not, she'll get her wish."
    "Then it won't all have been so pointless. Take that, fate."
    
    "The halls at Mirako are hopping. You'd think it was an hour later than it actually is. I guess it is the eve of the festival, after all. Anything that's not set up needs to get done today or tonight."
    "...I can't spot anyone I know, though."
    "And when I get to homeroom, there's no one there. Everyone here early must be outside or down at the gym. Time to head down there and see what's changed in the past few days, then."
    "The place is almost unrecognizable. Half the room is dotted with chairs and folding tables, and the other half is displays of all kinds. Post are posterboards advertising clubs, but a few are more elaborate with banners and tents."
    "I spot Kenta over in a corner that's suspiciously surrounded by boxes. At least I recognize that new cabinet. I'm not exactly happy to see the thing. It belongs in our room, and, after all, it did give me a black eye."
    takeru "Kenta. Yo, Kenta!"
    kenta "Good morning, Takeru."
    takeru "Good morning. What exactly is going on here?"
    kenta "I see you got my request. Thanks for helping out."
    takeru "What? Your request? No one said I was planning to give you a hand, er, even if I was, so could you - "
    kenta "You got the schedule, correct?"
    takeru "Kenta, that's not how you ask for help."
    kenta "Should I have asked you at 5:00 AM? I did a few times but you didn't reply. I wanted to wake you up, but something told me you wouldn't appreciate it."
    takeru "Thank you, Kenta. Thank you for not getting me up at five in the morning."
    kenta "In return, could you hold this?"
    takeru "This, er... What... What is that?"
    kenta "It's a piece of wood. What does it look like?"
    "It is indeed a piece of wood. A two by four. It looks oddly familiar."
    "I check the cabinet Kenta abducted from behind my bed, but it looks like it has all its boards in place. No suspiciously missing pieces of wood."
    takeru "This... is another cabinet, isn't it?"
    kenta "Same structure, but my own design. I didn't have the equipment to drill the holes, so I've settled on dovetail joints. I think you'll agree it's more elegant this way."
    takeru "And, er, you're holding a hand saw. That's fine."
    takeru "And the other half of this board is being held by a sawhorse. That's, er..."
    takeru "You must have a lot of stuff to display."
    kenta "I've spent a lot of time on my hobbies. It's only fitting to show off a bit at the festival. The cabinet is my first work, even if it was premade, it did get me into the whole - "
    takeru "There's nothing in the cabinet, Kenta."
    kenta "The cabinet itself is the display."
    takeru "Yeah, it's the display for what?"
    kenta "You have a very roundabout way of asking things Takeru. I'm demonstrating my carpentry skills."
    takeru "No way, what the - "
    takeru "Your what now? Carpentry?"
    kenta "The craft of construction. It's also an art, if you ask me. In the past few days I've become quite an - "
    takeru "Fantastic. Absolutely."
    kenta "I'm glad you agree."
    takeru "So you're just putting together a bunch of furniture? That's your display?"
    kenta "I've made some headway."
    "Kenta gestures at the two tables I passed on my way to his corner. I noticed they were unpainted wood before, but now I see they're clearly homemade. The sawhorse too, it looks like."
    takeru "I'm almost impressed. You've been at this what, a week, tops?"
    kenta "It seems like quite a while, doesn't it?"
    takeru "At least when this is all over we won't run out of room in the dorm for frogs..."
    kenta "Frogs?"
    takeru "Frogs. You know, you put them in jars and leave them next to my face for when I wake up in the morning?"
    kenta "Oh I donated all those to the Mirako biology lab. It's a bit of a childish hobby."
    takeru "Right..."
    takeru "Kenta, what are you doing with all this when the festival is over?"
    kenta "Like you said, we can never have enough space. All morning I've been thinking of new schemes. I think if we moved the winter wear to its own dresser, we'd save on average twenty seconds day compared to - "
    takeru "You know what? Never mind. Tell me what I'm supposed to hold or saw or whatever. Talking is just going to hold this up."
    kenta "Takeru, you're a good man. You understand the value of efficiency."
    
    "There's still probably half an hour until I have to be at class, but my arms are sore."
    "I'm not sure I'm getting much done either. If all I'm doing is holding beams and boards steady while Kenta cuts them, I think the sawhorse is more useful than me."
    "At least we're making progress. The pile of wood is now... Well, a pile of slightly smaller pieces of wood."
    takeru "How do you have the patience for this?"
    kenta "I don't understand."
    takeru "Just doing this over and over? Getting nowhere?"
    kenta "I do this for fun. And when I'm done we get more furniture."
    takeru "I'm warning you, we're not moving my bed out to make room for all this."
    kenta "Fantastic idea. Next week, we can try making a bed frame. Classical style."
    takeru "No. I'm not sleeping anywhere near anything you designed."
    "I turn away from bickering with Kenta towards the corner of the gym. Kenta's in the back, right next to the side door. What caught my attention was the person slipping in."
    "Meiko."
    "She stops when she sees me. I'm not sure if I should call out to her. Go back to work with Kenta?"
    "Meiko doesn't look too sure either. She settles on a half smile. I guess I'll wave, when..."
    kenta "Good morning, Meiko!"
    "She shies away from Kenta's booming voice for a moment, then breaks into that composed, friendly smile."
    meiko "Good morning, Kenta. How's the setup going? I'm always interested in what you have to show."
    kenta "Excellent. Takeru and I are displaying our carpentry and other - "
    takeru "You don't need to credit me."
    kenta "...and it's really starting to come together."
    meiko "I'm glad to hear it."
    takeru "How's yours coming Meiko?"
    kenta "Meiko, you're putting up a display? For the student council or on your own?"
    meiko "It's on my own, although... It's..."
    kenta "Let's see."
    meiko "Well..."
    kenta "I don't mind if you're still setting up. I'll see tomorrow anyway."
    meiko "That's right, isn't it..."
    "She glances at me."
    meiko "It's outside."
    kenta "There's display space out there? What if it rains?"
    "Meiko doesn't respond and instead walks back to the door, opening it."
    kenta "This way then?"
    "I follow."
    kenta "It's chilly out. Where is this?"
    "Most of the clubs have booths and tents out here, so there's just as many people wandering around, moving chairs and setting up tables. Meiko, however, heads to a far corner."
    kenta "I didn't even know there was anything over here."
    "What she leads us to is... not really a display. It looks to be built on a desk, although not the kind we have in class. Did she bring this from somewhere?"
    "And on it is a small shrine. For the dead? It's a wooden construction with doors that open a single hanging lantern inside."
    kenta "You made this? Impressive. I should probably be getting you to help me with carpentry instead of Takeru."
    meiko "It's missing candles. And I don't have a good photo. I wish I could find one, or the rest of that chess set for that matter..."
    "My heart skips a beat, but I remain silent. Meiko has a strange expression."
    kenta "Oh, it's a memorial. I assume this is for that student who died last year."
    kenta "I'll come by tomorrow, but I should go back to work. There's only a day left to work, after all."
    meiko "Goodbye."
    "Kenta wanders off back towards the gym. Meiko, however, stands by the shrine."
    takeru "Then that is for Hikari."
    meiko "I'm surprised you know that name."
    takeru "Most days I'm surprised I know it as well."
    meiko "What's that supposed to mean?"
    takeru "I really don't know how to explain."
    "I need to think of a way though. This might be my one chance to convince Meiko about the fireworks. I said I'd do it for Hikari, so I've got to follow through."
    "Meiko doesn't quite look at me straight. I realize I'm fidgeting."
    takeru "I know where the rest of the chess set is. That painted one you were looking for yesterday, that's missing the knight. This is why you wanted it, right?"
    meiko "You said yesterday - "
    takeru "Come on."
    "I don't really want to explain why I lied to her back in the tea room the other day, either."
    "We head inside, and then upstairs."
    "Hopefully no one's in the team room. Luckily when I open the door, it's dark. Nobody."
    "Meiko blinks as I turn on the lights."
    meiko "You mean it's in this room? I forgot this place even existed. Wasn't this an office last year? I see the old library books made it in."
    takeru "An office... You mean this isn't the old library?"
    meiko "That's a funny name for it. It's much too small to be the library for a school like Mirako, even if the older books did end up here after the fire."
    takeru "Right..."
    meiko "What do you come up here for?"
    takeru "Nothing much. Let me just find those pieces for you... I know Mana put them on a shelf around here somewhere after Hikari brought them up..."
    meiko "What're you mumbling?"
    takeru "Here."
    "It's a cheap, wooden box, the type you could find anywhere, but Meiko's reaction is immmediate."
    meiko "That's amazing. How did you - "
    meiko "Thank you, Takeru."
    "I offer her the box, but she's hesitant to take it."
    meiko "I, um... Thanks. You don't think it's weird that I was, well..."
    takeru "No."
    takeru "I think I understand, sort of. You were her friend right?"
    meiko "Um."
    meiko "Something like that."
    "Meiko keeps frowning. It takes her a few moments to put together an answer."
    meiko "I'd put together a memorial for any student though. It's my duty to the class as a student council member. Isn't it?"
    takeru "Er, I guess, but... Wouldn't the whole council sponsor it then?"
    takeru "Never mind. That's not important. Right."
    "I don't want to press it, but..."
    takeru "A week or two ago, when I asked about the fireworks... I asked why you decided not to have the display this year."
    meiko "The council decided that - "
    takeru "I overheard, remember?"
    meiko "Ah."
    takeru "Her name came up."
    meiko "I explained this."
    meiko "It would be disrespectful for Mirako to have a fireworks celebration this year given that the way she died, she - "
    meiko "The fireworks had nothing to do with it, it's just, she just, they - "
    meiko "..."
    takeru "They were her favorite thing in the world, right?"
    meiko "How do you know that?"
    takeru "I can't really explain it. You probably wouldn't, er..."
    meiko "And you knew where the chess pieces were, too."
    takeru "The supernatural club meets here. I came for lunch and happened to see them, so - "
    meiko "That's alright."
    meiko "You don't trust me that much."
    takeru "You won't tell me how you even knew Hikari. And you're the one who told me not to trust you, right?"
    meiko "That was me, wasn't it?"
    meiko "Strange, isn't it? Sometimes I think you're a million miles away. And then - "
    meiko "I sort of miss when you talked to me every day. And you weren't self-conscious about it, you sort of..."
    takeru "Trusted you?"
    meiko "I guess."
    meiko "You don't miss it?"
    takeru "Miss..."
    "I know what she's talking about. I think I do. It's not the way we were a few weeks ago, it's the way were a few years ago. Was it ever...?"
    "Meiko frowns. Something slips at the corner of her eyes. She turns, but when she looks back, she has one a flat half-smile."
    meiko "There are no fireworks this year because they were Hikari's favorite thing in the world. You're right."
    meiko "Putting on the show without her would be terrible. An insult. So I used my authority, and voila, there's no fireworks this year."
    takeru "You're angry with me."
    meiko "No. I'm grateful, even if you don't - "
    meiko "You found me the chess pieces. She carved these, but you might already know that."
    meiko "If you want to help me remember her, then help me with the shrine. And you're doing that already. So I'm grateful."
    meiko "See you later, Takeru."
    takeru "Bye."
    "She's speaking fast, uncomfortable. Then she turns to leave."
    "I stand in place as she pulls open the door. And to my surprise, there's someone else outside it."
    meiko "Sorry. Didn't see you there."
    hagami "..."
    "I'm left facing Hagami in the doorway as Meiko disappears down the hall."
    "Neither of us speaks."
    "Not sure what to, I sit down. Hagami takes a few steps inside and shuts the door."
    takeru "How much of that did you hear?"
    hagami "Most."
    takeru "She's my friend on the student council. Er, friend might not be the right word, maybe..."
    hagami "It's not important."
    takeru "What?"
    hagami "I meant I heard the part about Hikari."
    takeru "Er, right. I don't know why I thought you'd be interested in all that old stuff, so..."
    hagami "I found it."
    takeru "Found what?"
    hagami "Hikari."
    takeru "She's not an 'it.'"
    hagami "Her nature."
    hagami "The fireworks..."
    hagami "You already know?"
    takeru "Know what? Know what's wrong with Hikari? If I did I wouldn't have to be worrying about her, right? I thought..."
    takeru "This sounds dumb, but she said she wanted to see the fireworks, didn't she? So I..."
    takeru "I kind of got distracted talking to Meiko, but if we don't save Hikari, I just wanted to do something for her. I guess."
    hagami "That's..."
    "I'm used to Hagami not finishing her sentences, but something about the way she's squinting about me makes me feel uncomfortable."
    hagami "We'll be late."
    takeru "What?"
    takeru "Oh right, class. I'll see you at lunch?"
    hagami "We'll talk."
    takeru "Yeah. Okay sounds good. I hope you have good news."
    "Hagami just keeps up that inscrutable face. And then she leaves."
    "I follow, but she takes a right while I make a left and head downstairs."
    "Somewhere I think I made a mistake. What should the fireworks have to do with whatver Hagami knows? It's not related, is it? It's going to be a long few hours until lunch."
    
    "I wait through class."
    "Nobody else really seems to be paying attention either. Tomorrow's the festival, after all."
    "Meiko doesn't say a word to me, but Natsumi, of course..."
    natsumi "Earth to Takeru. Earth to Takeru."
    takeru "You don't have to say it right in my ear."
    natsumi "Nothing else seemed to be getting through to you."
    takeru "Take a hint."
    natsumi "Oh you're just no fun. Well you know all you have to do is say you will, and I'm gone. In a snap. So fast you can't even - "
    takeru "I get it. Say I'll do what?"
    natsumi "Hang out at the festival tomorrow. You, me, Meiko probably. That funny roommate of yours. Yeah, bring Kenta."
    natsumi "The baseball team's got nothing going on tomorrow because I thought we'd still be out of town. But now I just want to forget about all that, so you're going to help."
    takeru "What happens if I say no?"
    natsumi "I'll keep bugging you all day."
    takeru "You're terrible."
    takeru "Fine. A friend of mine is performing some piano thing, so I want to see that, but apart from that, I'm free."
    natsumi "Smart. You wouldn't want me breathing down your neck all day when you look all glum like that."
    natsumi "Seriously though. What's up?"
    takeru "Just worried."
    natsumi "Yeah obviously. I mean what in particular?"
    takeru "It's sort of hard to explain. Do you believe in - "
    takeru "Actually, I'm just worried about tomorrow. There's a bunch of things that could happen..."
    "Hagami will perform. Right? And Hikari will be alright. Did I get through to Meiko about the fireworks? She's just staring at her desk over there."
    takeru "...and some that probably won't happen."
    natsumi "Careful, if you're that vague you'll just make me curious. Is this about the legend?"
    takeru "Legend?"
    "Does this have anything to do with Hikari?"
    natsumi "Yeah. The legend."
    natsumi "If you see the fireworks reflected in the eyes of your beloved... It's bound to last forever."
    takeru "..."
    takeru "Stop staring at me."
    natsumi "Ha! You looked away first."
    takeru "Stop joking around. There aren't any fireworks this year anyway."
    natsumi "Booo."
    natsumi "What's up with that again, Meiko?"
    meiko "Hm?"
    "Natsumi elbows Meiko but she keeps her eyes on her desk."
    natsumi "I'm just kidding. Come on!"
    natsumi "What's with everyone today? The festival's tomorrow. You're supposed to be excited!"
    natsumi "Takeru you look like you're moping around in an existential crisis. Or maybe you've got a bad stomach bug. Can't tell."
    takeru "I thought you said that once I promised I was coming tomorrow, you'd quiet down."
    natsumi "I did, I did..."
    natsumi "Alright, but you'd both better be looking more cheerful tomorrow."
    "Maybe."
    "I was looking forward to the festival. I think I still am? Once I know Hikari's fine I think I'll be doing a lot better. And once I figure out what on earth is going through Meiko's head."
    "That last one might take a while longer."
    
    "Natsumi does not give up, however."
    "It's not until lunch time that she stops talking about the festival, what her plans are for tomorrow, and about how Meiko and I don't properly exemplify the Mirako spirit."
    "I could care less about the Mirako spirit. I flee into the hallway and make for the old wing. Hagami said she had answers, right? That should put at least one of my worries to rest."
    "There's no one down here today. I guess everything in storage has already been moved out already. Except for that box in the piano room, of course..."
    "I wonder. Was it ever really possible to get Meiko to agree to something like that?"
    "It's not like I promised Hikari. I just sort of decided it was something I'd try to do. I never told her about it, so I should be able to -"
    "She's standing there, across the hall from the piano room. Hikari is staring at the closed door."
    takeru "Hikari?"
    hikari "Oh, Takeru. Hello."
    takeru "What're you doing here?"
    hikari "Even you should have noticed I spend ninety percent of my time down here. It's not very unusual."
    takeru "You were looking at that room across the hall, with the piano."
    takeru "...There's no one in there, right?"
    hikari "No."
    takeru "Then..."
    hikari "If you have to know, Hagami just left."
    takeru "You were listening to her practice?"
    hikari "You could say that."
    takeru "I think you spend most of your time eavesdropping, not hanging around down here."
    hikari "It's not eavesdropping. She was only in there for a few minutes anyway."
    takeru "I've never even heard her play. You have a knack for turning up when people are trying to have private moments."
    hikari "As far as I know, I've only listened in when you're talking to that Meiko girl. Are those all private moments, then?"
    takeru "Fine. Come on. Let's just go upstairs, Hagami said she found something."
    hikari "Something?"
    takeru "About your, er, condition. Whatever it is that's..."
    hikari "Ah."
    hikari "It's all strange, isn't it?"
    takeru "What?"
    hikari "Hagami knows me. She remembers me like you do, doesn't she? And she practically knows more about what I am than I do..."
    hikari "It's only you and her. You both can remember my name for more than a day. Before I'd be happy with an hour. I was a classmate to all of these people and they don't even recognize me when I introduce myself..."
    hikari "Hell, now I'd even be happy to recognize them. I hate this."
    takeru "Maybe Hagami figure that out as well. And you can always just ask her."
    hikari "That, well..."
    hikari "Maybe we should just go upstairs."
    
    "When we arrive at the library, the radio is on at its low buzz, and Hagami and Mana are just sitting down to lunch."
    "As soon as Hikari enters behind me, Mana pops out of her seat."
    mana "Hello! Hikari?"
    hikari "What the - "
    mana "You must be Hikari! It's so exciting to finally meet you. Hagami was telling me how you're a master of the occult, and you can tell peoples' fortunes, and you know all their past lives just by looking at them, and..."
    hikari "Well. She said all that, did she? What am... introduction."
    "Hikari winces with that last word as Mana keeps rambling on. I note Hagami in the corner is trying not to laugh. I'm glad it's not always me on the receving end of her weird humor."
    "When she notices I'm looking her way, Hagami gestures for me to come over."
    takeru "Hey."
    hagami "Hi."
    takeru "You said you found something."
    hagami "A breakthrough."
    takeru "You know what the cure is? For Hikari's memory?"
    hagami "A bit of a breakthrough..."
    hagami "First..."
    hagami "The first step is to know her nature."
    hagami "Can't do anything without that. That's what..."
    hikari "You can't tell Takeru first when I'm not listening. You are talking about me, aren't you?"
    hagami "Sorry."
    "But I can tell Hagami's tone changed as soon as she saw Hikari and Mana turn back to us."
    mana "You've found the source of Hikari's power? Already?"
    hikari "Power source? What garbage have you been feeding this girl?"
    mana "Then you can't... That was all..."
    hikari "My 'power source' is that I'm dead."
    mana "Oh. Sorry. But that does explain all of your abilities!"
    hikari "The dead don't usually walk around and chat with you, do they?"
    mana "Well no... I sure wish they did though!"
    hikari "And I wish I knew why I did."
    hagami "That's..."
    "Hagami answers with a book. She drops it onto the table with a thwap. It's not so heavy? Actually, it looks like a binder more than a book."
    "She opens it. Inside is... sheet music? And pages and pages of paper covered in diagrams of the human body, all with twisting lines and labels in French scrawling across the page. Hagami continues to thumb through it. Only the last few pages are prose."
    "Then there's a header page. It looks like a flier. An advertisement?"
    hagami "It's an opera. La Dame Blanche. By Berlioz, the only one he wrote."
    hikari "A what?"
    hagami "It's about a ghost. The heroine dies at the start."
    hikari "You're saying I'm a character from an opera? That looks centuries old. What are you - "
    takeru "Let her explain."
    hagami "...It's just an example. It's based on legend, even older. See..."
    hagami "The story has the same theme. Even from cultures oceans apart. This is just... the example I know best."
    hagami "Giselle is the heroine. She's shy, but she's a dancer. She's engaged to Albrecht, but she has a weak heart. She dies in his arms."
    hagami "So she has unfinished business. She comes back from the dead to finish it. To marry him, I guess. But she forgets he exists. And he gets engaged to Bathilde instead. He forgets her."
    hikari "This doesn't sound like it has a happy ending."
    hagami "But then they dance together at the midnight ball. And everything comes back. To both of them."
    hagami "There's more after that. It's a fairy tale so the ending is bitter, but they're happy before that. And their memory comes back."
    hikari "Ending up dead at the end of all this is pretty much expected. But you're saying this is... How do I fit into this?"
    hagami "The common part of all these legends and stories is that the dead come back to finish what they left in life."
    hagami "Even if sometimes they forget that life. When the complete their work, it comes back."
    mana "This seems really complicated."
    hikari "I didn't exactly have anything unfinished. I was unfulfilled I guess, but..."
    takeru "I get it. Hikari, it's the fireworks."
    hikari "The fireworks?"
    takeru "You said... All you wanted to do was spend time with your friends under the fireworks."
    hikari "I miss the fireworks, but I hardly remember those friends. You really think..."
    takeru "That's the point. It'll all come back with the fireworks."
    mana "Aren't those cancelled this year? That's terrible!"
    takeru "Maybe not."
    takeru "I talked to Meiko. I don't think I changed her mind, but, it's a start."
    hikari "Don't be ridiculous. You can't just put on a fireworks show with a day of planning. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the effort, Takeru, but this just seems like a dead end. I don't see what - "
    takeru "The fireworks are here. The box is downstairs. The order isn't refundable, so - "
    takeru "Never mind, but it's possible. I'll talk to Meiko again. This is more important than I thought. I just have to find a way."
    hikari "It's not important. It's feasible, besides, they'd have to work in time, and - "
    mana "There's a big chunk of time at the end where they could do it!"
    takeru "Is that the program?"
    mana "It came out today."
    "She opens a multipage pamphlet, and sure enough, there's a map of the school, a timetable, and general info on what's going on where."
    "Each club or display has its own info printed as well. I think I helped edit this."
    "Mana opens to the last page. There's the schedule for the main stage, outside by the fields."
    mana "It just says 'Speeches from the council: TBD...' And that's right as it's getting dark, too."
    mana "Meiko's on the student council! It's probably her speaking. And there's nobody using it afterwards. And before..."
    mana "Hang on, what?"
    "I scan up the table to a time slot just before the council speeches. A name a recognize is printed there."
    mana "'Inori Hagami - Beethoven Piano Sonata No.14 Moonlight...'"
    mana "Hagami! You're performing? Why didn't you tell me? No kidding around, okay? I can't believe it!"
    hagami "Sorry."
    mana "Sorry? What do you mean? I'm thrilled! I'm so excited! I haven't heard you play anything in ages, and in public, wow, I can't..."
    hagami "I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier. I wasn't sure if I..."
    hagami "It was going to be a surprise."
    mana "I'm surprised already! When was the last time you played the piano for other people? Are you nervous? You must be nervous."
    hagami "Yes."
    mana "You'll be fine. Oh I can't wait! First you'll be on, and then maybe the fireworks will be back... Have you been practicing? What's the piece like? When did you..."
    "Hikari slides closer to me while Mana turns her attention to Hagami."
    takeru "What - "
    "She whispers."
    hikari "Has she been practicing though? She's been researching every night."
    takeru "You just heard her like ten minutes ago."
    hikari "Did you?"
    takeru "She already left when I came down, right?"
    hikari "I waited by that door, but I didn't hear anything. Not a sound."
    takeru "Maybe it's a quiet song?"
    hikari "You have very strange friends, Takeru..."
    takeru "I don't get it."
    hikari "I'm not sure I do either. I'm grateful to Hagami even her conclusions are a little, well, suspect. So I won't be rude, but I think there's something odd going on."
    takeru "Maybe it's a prank after all."
    hikari "As long as it's not on me again."
    takeru "I'm with you there."
    mana "...and I'll get the whole swim team, too. I'm so happy for you. I had no idea you were ready for this kind of thing."
    hagami "Neither did I."
    mana "Takeru, you'll come, won't you?"
    takeru "For sure."
    mana "And Hikari?"
    hikari "I wasn't planning on going to the festival, really."
    mana "No way! How could you be a student here and not come? Is there a full moon or something? Do you need to gather herbs? Or perform a ritual on the night when - "
    hikari "I'll go."
    mana "And you'll watch Hagami too! This will be fantastic!"
    "Mana continues to positively vibrate with excitement. Hagami just slowly eats her lunch."
    "I can see why she wanted to hold off telling Mana."
    "But didn't Hagami say she didn't want to disappoint Mana? Wasn't she unsure whether she'd actually play or not? I guess she must've gotten over whatever was bothering her if she's officially on the schedule."
    "Hikari seems to have picked up on it as well. She doesn't take her eyes off the pair until lunch is almost over."
    hikari "Takeru, Mana's just going to forget I promised to come if you don't remind her, so don't bring it up."
    takeru "Why not? You don't want to come? Isn't that what you were looking forward to last year?"
    hikari "Not really. The festival wasn't as important as the people I'd be enjoying it with. And if I can't even remember them or talk to them it's pointless."
    takeru "We count, right?"
    hikari "Count as what?"
    takeru "You really don't think we're your friends?"
    hikari "Hah. You can be a little dull Takeru but you have your moments."
    hikari "And the rest of the club..."
    "Hikari looks over to Mana who keeps pushing the festival schedule under Hagami's nose while she's trying to eat."
    hikari "Alright, I'll come. I'll even watch Hagami perform. She did try her best at this whole ghost research thing."
    takeru "You think she's wrong?"
    hikari "Do you really buy her story?"
    takeru "Yeah. I mean, nothing about you makes sense anyway, and Hagami seems pretty sure about it. I believe her."
    hikari "That's good."
    hikari "Maybe being locked in that tea room really did make me a cynic."
    hikari "Alright, Takeru, I'll come and I'll even watch the fireworks. I'll be an optimist and count on you to figure out a way to make it happen."
    takeru "Meiko will figure it out. I just need to convince her."
    hikari "Thank you."
    hikari "I don't know if I've said that before..."
    hikari "And if I'm honest... I really would like to see the fireworks again, even if I forget it ever happened."
    hikari "If it turns out I'm going to forget all my old memories anyways, might as well try and make some new ones."
    
    "I leave early to catch Meiko before class starts up again. When I get back to the classroom, there should be at least ten minutes."
    "And she's not there when I show up."
    "Good."
    "I have to think. What is it I'm even going to say?"
    "Do I explain how I know Hikari? She'll think I'm insane. Do I make something up? Not mention Hikari at all?"
    "Okay, take a step back, Takeru. You already made your case. There's no need to get nervous about this."
    "Still, I can feel myself starting to sweat. Why should I be nervous in the first place?"
    "I just hope last time I didn't offend her. It felt like I stepped on her foot this morning and I hope I didn't ruin everything. And the only way to find out if I screwed this up..."
    "...is to talk to her. That's why I can't seem to sit still."
    "I keep track of every person walking through the door. No sign of her. Half the room is here. Then three quarters. Then only two desks are emtpy, both next to mine."
    "And Natsumi enters just at the bell rings."
    takeru "Oh, it's you."
    natsumi "Yep, it's me. You must be relieved. Were you worried I wouldn't make it in time? Never fear, I - "
    takeru "I really wasn't that concerned about you."
    natsumi "I know, I know. You were waiting for Meiko. Weren't you?"
    takeru "Maybe."
    takeru "If I were looking for her... Do you know where she is?"
    natsumi "She'd never skip, so she's probably in some meeting or other in the front office. Or the student council. Or the festival committe. Or both at the same time."
    natsumi "Honestly I'm amazed she finds time for class at all."
    takeru "Right."
    natsumi "So if you're gonna bug her about something silly, just remember there's a million more interesting people she could be talking to instead. Like me."
    takeru "Huh. I didn't realize I was that annoying to her... Yeah, maybe I should just - "
    natsumi "I was just kidding around. You should know not to take me that seriously."
    takeru "Oh."
    natsumi "Are you really worried about pissing her off though? She's the one that seems like she's always trying to talk to you."
    takeru "Really?"
    natsumi "Don't tell her I said this, but she does seem different when you're around. Less, uh..."
    natsumi "Tough to say. She seems more like a woman of iron than a woman of steel."
    takeru "Was that supposed to be encouraging?"
    natsumi "I don't know. Just calling it as I see it."
    takeru "She probably does have enough to deal with without me running around though..."
    natsumi "I don't know what you've got planned, but..."
    natsumi "Do me a favor. If you do manage to find her, tell her to take it easy. If she works any harder for this festival thing she'll die of exhaustion before tomorrow and then all my plans are shot. Big pain."
    natsumi "I've got no clue how she can do all that and not look at all the worse for wear. Hell after even one tough game I'm useless in class the next day."
    takeru "You're never all that useful in class."
    natsumi "Oh quiet down, you dope. The lesson's starting."
    "Natsumi makes a big show of watching the blackboard and intently taking down notes, but I'm still drifting out in space."
    "So she doesn't see it? Natsumi doesn't see any sign all that festival stress is getting to Meiko?"
    "I thought they were good friends. Natsumi seems observant enough, but maybe it's true what she said..."
    "Everyone here sees her as super-human, able to score top marks, organize half the festival, and even help the class study in her spare time, all without breaking a sweat."
    "Am I really the only one who's ever seen her sweating?"
    
    "There's less than an hour left in the school day, and I'm still struggling to come up with a way to win over Meiko."
    "Or even to break the silence. What am I supposed to do? Walk up to her and strongarm her into reconsidering? Plead with her?"
    "Or I could explain how Hikari isn't actually dead, she's somewhere between life and death, and we trust each other, and she gives me advice, and I'm not crazy I swear. Except maybe I am."
    "At the least, I'll drive myself crazy if I can't figure out a way to solve this."
    "Do I make something up? Lie to Meiko? Anything's worth it to save Hikari."
    natsumi "Look alive, Takeru."
    takeru "What now?"
    natsumi "Class is over! Get up, you're free! I'll be mad tomorrow if you're this out of it. Seriously."
    takeru "Oh. I guess I missed the bell."
    natsumi "And you were making fun of me for being useless in class? Maybe you'd like to borrow my notes. I'm a very studious and smart person so I always - "
    natsumi "Oh hey, I think that's Tomita calling. I've got to run."
    "She waves and follows a few members of the baseball team out the door. Looks like I'm the last left in the room."
    "And Meiko still isn't back."
    "Guess my problem won't be figuring out what to say, it'll be actually tracking her down."
    "...Unless she left already."
    "I head for library. I think that's where the student council meets, right?"
    "Nobody there. Everyone staying after class is down in the gym, probably."
    "I look briefly around, but no sign of her. I do spot Kenta though, and I duck back into the hall before I get conned into hauling Kenta's improvised furniture to or from the dorm."
    "Where did I see her yesterday? The tea room?"
    "Empty."
    "The door to the piano room is open though. Of course, it's small enough to tell she's not in there either."
    "For whatever reason, I enter and set my bag down on the box of fireworks equipment, then page through the papers on the clipboard."
    "As far as I can tell, there's been no change. Would Meiko need these if she was going to reschedule the fireworks show? Has she not had the time to find this yet?"
    "I'm about to give up when I realize I've been forgetting the most obvious place. I leave out the back entrance and walk around the exterior of the building, past the cliff that drops onto the hill, past the path to the fields, and around to the gym entrance."
    "The stage is visible back by the road, all set up for tomorrow. And there's the memorial that Meiko's been constructing, tucked in a corner. And Meiko sitting on the table with it."
    meiko "Takeru?"
    takeru "Er, sorry. If you're doing something I didn't mean to - "
    meiko "Oh, no. I'm glad to see you. I think. Um, well..."
    meiko "I need you to tell me I made the right call."
    takeru "The right call?"
    meiko "Never mind. I overestimated how much this meant to you, I'm sure. Again. Only I've been agonizing over this all day for some reason I just can't place, it'd be unfair to blame you for..."
    takeru "Are you alright?"
    meiko "I've been better."
    "She looks pale. It's only when I'm closer do I see those dark marks under her eyes, the slight wrinkle that reminds of that time she mumbled through her speech to the class. Or when I met her by the dorms that day we went to fetch the grill."
    "It's a far cry from how I usually see her: composed, serene, in control. Now even her voice is tired."
    meiko "Just ignore me. I'm sure this makes no sense to you."
    "I feel uncomfortable standing while she sits on the makeshift table, but with the shrine there, there isn't a whole lot of room."
    "So instead I sit on the opposite side of the table. We're back to back."
    takeru "Look, I get this isn't a great time, I'm sure you're busy and all, but, er..."
    takeru "It's hard to explain why this is important, but it's about the fireworks again."
    meiko "Strange."
    takeru "What?"
    meiko "That's what I was rambling about. Did you pick up on it after all?"
    takeru "No... This has kind of been eating me all day."
    meiko "Funny. I haven't managed to calm down since lunch."
    takeru "The call?"
    meiko "To Fujiworks, to tell them to show up tomorrow. The committe thought it'd be a great surprise ending, the council couldn't make up their minds but signed off anyway, and the principal wasn't pleased..."
    meiko "I did it though. I shouldn't have."
    meiko "I came out here to see Hikari and I feel like I let her down."
    "It's hard for me to process. Does this mean I've already done what I came here for? If I left right now, the fireworks would still be on tomorrow, right?"
    "But... Meiko's second guessing herself."
    meiko "I feel every day without her. Nobody else does. How is it that you, a transfer student, seem to remember her better than anyone else here that actually knew her? Do they want to move on so much that they, that they..."
    meiko "I think I caved in. Everyone knows Mirako's festival centers around the fireworks. Everyone else on the council just wanted to keep on with the tradition, like nothing happened, and every day, they asked me."
    meiko "Now today I let them do it. I think I let Hikari down."
    takeru "I think it's the opposite."
    meiko "How?"
    "Her breathing behind me comes in short, ragged bursts. For a moment I can feel her tremble."
    takeru "Imagine she's watching somewhere."
    meiko "I hope she's watching over me, up there."
    takeru "What would she want to see, one year after she passed away? A memorial service? Maybe a dedication and then a moment of silence where you'd normally put the firworks?"
    takeru "She never saw them when she was alive. Dedicate the fireworks to her, and let her see them now. And let her see you enjoying them, even if you wish she was still there with you. Hell, maybe she will be."
    "The only reply is silence."
    "I tried to be helpful for once in my miserable life so no doubt I've managed to offend her and blow the fireworks things at the same time."
    "But then... Meiko's not going anywhere. Almost like she fell asleep."
    "Finally:"
    meiko "I needed to hear that. I'll do it for her."
    takeru "You were close, right? Friends? I guess I didn't realize just how much you really did remember her."
    meiko "Friends... You could say..."
    "Quiet again."
    takeru "Never mind. I know you can't really trust me so I'll leave it. I'm not asking you to, er... If can't forgive me after I was an idiot in junior high, I can't - "
    meiko "You're hopeless."
    takeru "I know. I'm sorry. I should - "
    meiko "Not like that. Don't go anywhere. Are you still hung up about that day at Cat's Corner?"
    takeru "I hadn't realized just how deeply I'd screwed up. I should've known you wouldn't be able to forgive me after just - "
    meiko "I'd already forgiven you the moment I told you all that. Don't you get it?"
    meiko "Just sitting here is trusting you. Just talking to you about how worried I am about the festival, about whether I made the right decision, over what Hikari would've thought, over all these million details that nobody else seems to notice..."
    meiko "I can't share that with anyone. I'm Meiko. I can take on three study sessions a week, head up the festival committee, and still earn top marks. I'm invincible."
    meiko "To everyone in Mirako, that's Meiko. I think you still see me as, well, me. That shutin that you had to drag out of her house every day in middle school."
    takeru "It's not like that."
    meiko "Then you..."
    "I'm improvising. I have no idea what to say and I've never thought about this before, but I feel like I need to tell her something before the moment evaporates."
    takeru "You've definitely changed. When I came here, those first couple days I could hardly recognize you."
    meiko "Ha. I had you fooled."
    takeru "I don't think so. You don't..."
    takeru "That's really you. You really are a talented person that can manage about ten times what I could ever hope to do. Just because you worry about it or stress the details or whatever doesn't make you anything less."
    takeru "You're still the Kotaru Meiko I knew."
    meiko "I hope, I really do hope. Takeru, though, I don't think you understand."
    "I can feel her stiffen behind me."
    meiko "That's why I'm here."
    takeru "Your purpose?"
    meiko "Haha. I wish."
    meiko "It's why I'm at Mirako. I really can't seem to stop worry about every little thing. I think maybe I did make the right decision and I'm sure Hikari really would be happier this way."
    meiko "But I need to make it up to the administration. I need to figure out who's going to meet the technician that Fujiworks is sending up tomorrow. Should I get the programs redone? No, probably not. But the stage is - "
    meiko "I need to take care of all that. And instead I spend all my time out here making sure the pieces are lined up straight. I couldn't even find a photo of her."
    meiko "I'm sorry."
    "She hops down off the table. I stand and face her."
    meiko "You've made this a lot easier on me. Don't worry about me from here on out. I'll take care of the festival. And then after tomorrow, I can sleep, maybe. Until then there's too much to do, too too much."
    meiko "I'll see you."
    takeru "You'll be with me and Natsumi tomorrow, right?"
    meiko "I forgot. I hope so. I think I will."
    takeru "If you're not, Natsumi will be after you."
    meiko "Ha. Bye, Takeru. You showed up at just the right time, but now I have to get to, uh - "
    meiko "Bye."
    "She passes through the door to the gym before I have to chance to say anything. Not that I'm really sure what to say."
    "I'm left in front of the shrine for Hikari. This seems like the perfect opportunity for her to jump out from nowhere and start making fun of me, but... nothing. My only company is my own thoughts."
    "The shrine is simple. Is it handmade? The only way to tell for whom it was built is the chessboard now lying in front of it. Every piece is perfectly centered in its own square, but there are only 31 pieces. A knight is missing, where Hikari and I would always use a thimble."
    "I wonder if that missing piece bothered Meiko. That's a detail. I try to lift one of the pawns, but it's attached to the board via a thin strip of two-sided tape. Clever. I suppose it's to prevent the wind from blowing it away."
    "It seems like such a trivial thing. Wasn't she looking for that chess set all of yesterday morning?"
    "Then again... I've been getting caught up in all the wrong problems as well."
    "Meiko said I was forgiven. She didn't care I'd forgotten all about her when I ran away to Tohoku. Do I believe her? I think I do, this time."
    "Maybe it's still not processing, but there's still a weight on my chest when I think about her, staring at that door she vanished through minutes ago. Why is it it's still so hard to talk to her, if she doesn't still have that grudge?"
    "When I first came to Mirako I thought of her as an anchor, someone I could trust and count on while I tried to find my bearings. That upset her. So I tried to keep my distance, but..."
    "It all seems to come back to her, doesn't it?"
    "All I can do is frown at the shrine."
    takeru "Hikari, are you there?"
    takeru "Guess that was a dumb question."
    "The good news is I was also wrong to worry about the fireworks. Of course Meiko will come through."
    "And with any luck Hikari will be watching from a lot closer than she thinks."
    
    "Time to go. The sun's almost setting and I can't afford to spend all evening sitting at this shrine."
    "I enter through the gym door."
    "There's still loads of students around putting the finishing touches on stands, booths, and display. Luckily I don't spot Kenta. Or Meiko."
    "I'm almost out the Mirako front doors when I realize a curious lightness around my shoulder..."
    "My bag. I must've put it down someplace when I was looking all over for Meiko."
    "I double back to the classroom, then the library, but of course, no luck."
    "Right. I set it down in the piano room when I was going over the Fujiworks Pyrotechnics order. I head to the old wing."
    "It's just as dusty and quiet down here as on any regular day. It seems the bustle of the world in the gym just can't work its way this far into the old school building."
    "There is one change I notice from the last time I was down here... The piano room door is closed."
    "Hagami?"
    "I listen for a few moments. Silence."
    "Then I listen for a few more."
    "Silence."
    "Of course, with how quietly she apparently practices it's not like this is a useful exercise. I'll just have to knock."
    takeru "Anyone home?"
    "Nothing. Guess I spent two minutes listening outside an empty room like an idiot."
    "But when I push open the door, Hagami is sitting on the piano stool, looking right at me. Or rather looking right through me."
    takeru "Hello?"
    "Finally she focuses in on me, but it takes her a second to respond. Finally, Hagami just raises an eyebrow."
    hagami "You should shut the door."
    takeru "What?"
    hagami "You're coming in."
    hagami "...Aren't you?"
    takeru "Right. Sorry."
    takeru "I left my bag in here, I think. Yeah, it's over by the box. I'll grab it and, er..."
    "She hasn't told me to get lost yet, and she isn't isn't looking very talkative either. With the door closed it feels like she wanted me for something."
    takeru "Practice is going well?"
    hagami "Not especially."
    takeru "Oh. I..."
    "I take a seat on the crate next to my bag."
    takeru "Have you done this before? Performed in front of a bunch of people?"
    hagami "I hardly remember it."
    hagami "...I knew what I was doing back then too."
    hagami "This isn't going to end well."
    takeru "I'm sure you'll be fine."
    hagami "You don't understand. You shouldn't..."
    hagami "You can't tell, but this... I can hardly sleep."
    hagami "What will Mana say?"
    takeru "She seems pretty happy about it. She was so excited you were going to do a recital I think she'll be thrilled even if you didn't get every note perfect."
    "I have no experience with music. I can't exactly give her tips. Hagami is reclusive around even a single person she doesn't know. She has to be nervous about a crowd. Maybe..."
    "Maybe I'm not totally useless."
    "I gulp. Time to dredge up some more memories I really wish I would just forget."
    takeru "When I started my first game at Tohoku I walked the first two guys I faced. I think I probably sweat through my hat too. One more ball and I think Coach would've taken me out."
    takeru "There was a good six months since I'd pitched for real in the junior league. I didn't used to get nerves, but when people that weren't my parents were actually showing up to watch our games, it was a little different."
    hagami "I used to do this all the time. I didn't notice people then."
    takeru "Yeah. You shut it out."
    hagami "It's like a trance."
    takeru "There are pitchers that are strategy masters and they have a pitch for every situation, and they go through plans with the catcher for every count, and..."
    takeru "I'm not a genius like that though. I'd just find a rhythm and throw hard. I struck the next three guys out and ended the inning."
    takeru "Once you get your feet you'll be fine. The way Mana was talking she said you were really good."
    hagami "No."
    takeru "She didn't say that?"
    hagami "She did. She knew me before I..."
    hagami "I'm not a genius either. Not a child prodigy, or... Even if I was the best in the world, better than my mother, it'd still be pointless."
    hagami "I thought it'd all come back. I don't want to be stuck like this forever."
    hagami "That's why I got to know you."
    hagami "It's stopped working."
    takeru "I'm sure it'll..."
    "No, I'm definitely useless. Hagami's eyes are unfocused again. I'm not sure she caught half of what I was saying."
    "Then with a dry laugh she turns back to the piano, puts her fingers to the keys, and plays eight chords, one after the other. I might not be musically literate, but it doesn't sound random to me. It sounds fine, for the five seconds she's actually playing."
    hagami "I'll live. I'll hate myself but I'll live. This isn't important."
    hagami "There's something else."
    takeru "Er..."
    hagami "Something I need to tell you. That's why I called you in."
    takeru "You called me in? I thought - "
    takeru "Never mind. What's up?"
    hagami "Hikari."
    takeru "Oh. I don't think I thanked you. I just knew you'd be able to get to the bottom of what she really was, and why her memories kept leaking, and... I know Hikari's a bit stuck up so she probably hasn't said much, but she's really grateful. I don't know what I'd do if - "
    hagami "It's wrong."
    takeru "...don't know what I'd do if she forgot about me so - "
    takeru "Er... Hang on, what? What's wrong?"
    "Hagami shuffles through a pile of books on the floor. I recognize some foreign philosophy textbook from upstairs, and there's sheet music mixed in at the bottom. Finally she comes up with that binder with the French title."
    takeru "That's the opera, right?"
    hagami "La Dame Blanche."
    takeru "Right, the one with the character that's whatever Hikari is, who forgets who she was and then..."
    "I slow down and then trail off. Hikari slowly shakes her head, staring at my feet."
    hagami "It's wrong."
    takeru "How can it be wrong? It's fiction, right? It can't be factually wrong, it's just made up."
    hagami "That's not the plot."
    takeru "Wait, you said it was something like Giselle dies but she's engaged, so she comes back, dances, and then regains her memories. You mean..."
    hagami "Giselle is a universal character. Common in tragedies. This one shows up all over. Short stories, lots of romantic ones, every Chekov story with a ghost. Operas too, and ballets, not just La Dame Blanche. Sylphide has one. Swan Lake too."
    takeru "One what?"
    hagami "It's hard to describe in one word. The spurned heroine who..."
    hagami "In La Dame Blanche, Giselle is engaged to Albrecht. Then she dies. She forgets Albrecht. Albrecht is engaged to the villainess, Bathilde."
    takeru "Right, that's what you said earlier. Was that not what really happens?"
    hagami "It is. But the ending..."
    hagami "They forget each other. Ghostly Giselle is bitter but Albrecht moves on. At the midnight ball, they dance."
    takeru "And their memories return?"
    hagami "Giselle remembers him. And then she disappears."
    takeru "Wait, what?"
    hagami "She remembers him, and then she's gone. She moves on to the afterlife, bitter and laughing. Albrecht remembers his old love and he's heartbroken. He kills himself. Drowns."
    hagami "It's a tragedy. Giselle is punished for staying in the mortal world by watching her fiance remarry. Albrecht is punished for forgetting Giselle by remembering her at midnight. There's no happy ending. Giselle is just gone."
    hagami "The universal character is a clinging, vanishing ghost."
    takeru "No way. That's not Hikari. Why would you think she's some fictional supercharacter?"
    hagami "There's one other universal concept. Not a character this time."
    "Hagami's eyes are closed now. But they open now, and she asks a question."
    hagami "Have you heard of limbo?"
    takeru "Sure. It's like, er... A waiting room? Is that right? If you're not good or evil, and someone up there decides?"
    hagami "Depends."
    hagami "It's universal. Ancient Greeks thought it was a field. In Jewish books it's just darkness. The Jains believe too."
    hagami "It's always a place where the dead go to forget. They forget their life on earth, before they can move on. That..."
    hagami "It's all I could find. I didn't want to have bad news. That's what I honestly believe though. That Hikari is fading because she's slowly starting to let go."
    hagami "That you can see her and talk with her..."
    hagami "It's tragedy. A divine joke."
    takeru "What are you talking about? This is about the opposite of what you said at lunch. Was that a lie? Wasn't this whole opera thing of yours a fairy tale?"
    "Hagami's eyes are wild. I realize I must be speaking too loudly, but I'm angry."
    "Not angry. I think I'm just frightened. I don't want to believe her, that's why I'm mad at her."
    hagami "Sorry."
    takeru "Why?"
    hagami "I didn't think Hikari would be there."
    hagami "You can't..."
    hagami "I'm a coward. I can't tell someone to their face that they'll forget themselves and fade into nothing. Or into... whatever's beyond. Or just vanish."
    takeru "Hikari..."
    takeru "Right. The fireworks. What will happen?"
    hagami "...?"
    takeru "It's supposed to be a surprise, but the fireworks are back on. Meiko came through. She knows Hikari from way back so she's pulling some strings to get the show back on."
    takeru "They way you put it at lunch, it sounded like that'd be the magic switch. Like the midnight ball or whatever. Hikari sees the one thing she was missing most from her living life and then she's back."
    takeru "What will happen?"
    hagami "In... In the real ending, after the ball... Giselle is gone. Or if you're religious, once you free yourself from the world, you're free to..."
    hagami "I'm sorry. I think she'll be gone."
    takeru "I don't believe it."
    takeru "How can you sound so confident about this?"
    hagami "I'm not."
    hagami "I did everything I could, but..."
    hagami "Every school of thought in the world has something to day about death and life after death. I'm just one small, insignificant, person."
    takeru "Right. Okay. Give me a minute."
    "I'm trying to imagine losing Hikari. Would everyday life be different? I can't see that far ahead. All I know is that there's a real possibility that something I say tomorrow, even today, could be the last thing I ever say to her."
    "Why is that so terrifying?"
    "I realize I'm the one zoning out now. I'm staring at a point about a thousand yards beyond Hagami. She blushes, then starts paging through La Dame Blanche again."
    hagami "I can't solve it. There's so little I can do."
    takeru "No. Don't blame yourself. I asked you to do this and you did your best. Thanks for being honest."
    hagami "I tried to do what I thought was best."
    takeru "I get it."
    hagami "If I'm being honest, there's one other thing."
    hagami "I'm worried."
    takeru "It can't be worse, right?"
    hagami "Bathilde, in the opera. She's made out to be the villain, but I've never understood."
    hagami "She's engaged to Albrecht. With Giselle gone, they're the only ones there for each other. But when Albrecht remembers Giselle, and Giselle disappears, Albrecht drowns himself in the lake. There's no happy ending for them either."
    takeru "Well you even said it's a tragedy."
    hagami "It's so pointless."
    hagami "I don't know why. I sympathize with her."
    takeru "What's that supposed to mean?"
    hagami "Can you tell Hikari?"
    takeru "Tell her what? You're really hard to undestand sometimes."
    hagami "Tell her there might not be a way out, and if the fireworks are as important as you say..."
    hagami "Make your peace. Just in case."
    hagami "I don't know what you think of Hikari, but please..."
    hagami "Stay here."
    takeru "I'm not throwing myself into a lake, if that's what you're talking about."
    hagami "..."
    takeru "Hey, I'm sorry if I don't really get it. It's a lot to take in, and I'm supposed to let Hikari know that..."
    takeru "Right."
    takeru "You probably have a lot more to deal with than me anyway. You've got your performance."
    takeru "Sorry if I distracted you, thanks again for going through those books with us when I know you could've been practicing."
    hagami "I'd do it all over again. Even if the result was..."
    takeru "I'll see you tomorrow, I guess. I should just go home."
    hagami "And Hikari? What will - "
    takeru "I have no idea. I don't want to run into her. I just want to think. Bye. Good luck tomorrow."
    "I wait for a reply, but Hagami just turns away. After a few seconds, she sighs."
    hagami "Goodbye."
    "I try to smile at her on my way out, but I'm so frustrated it probably just turned into a grimace."
    "With the door shut behind me, I stare into the darkened hall."
    "Hikari isn't here."
    "Thankfully."
    "What would I even say if I saw her right now? Hi Hikari, you're probably dead for real this time tomorrow, so, see you later?"
    "I couldn't stomach it."
    "Just smile and walk home, like last night? I can't lie like that. Hikari would see through it in a minute."
    "Please, please, just don't let me see her. If she was listening in... Or following me..."
    "I check over my shoulder. But Mirako's shadows are just shadows, not ghosts. I pass through the front gates with no sign of Hikari, or anyone else for that matter."
    "The moon's visible in the dim sky."
    "It was about this time Hikari and I went home yesterday. Less than 24 hours ago, I was looking forward to this festival. Hikari wasn't so optimistic. She said she'd give it a shot... but only because I asked."
    "So what? Do I just start turning as cynical as her and tell Hikari it's hopeless tomorrow?"
    "I don't really feel like it."
    "As I take each step down the road, my frustration turns to a strange kind of determination."
    "This doesn't change anything."
    "Hikari was prepared to just dissipate into the evening air, without warning, with just the tiniest sniff to mark she had ever been here."
    "I'm just her hapless, makeshift friend. If Hikari can have that kind of resolve, then I'd be a lousy friend indeed if I couldn't do it myself."
    "I'll tell her tomorrow, but it won't change anything."
    "Now in the worst case, she'll get that one wish she had on earth. It doesn't matter to me what Hagami or her stories have to say. The fireworks are tomorrow night. We'll enjoy them, together, whatever happens next be damned."
    

label day15:

    "It's a warm feeling."
    "A familiar memory. Not quite nostalgia, not something I can pinpoint as I come out of a dream."
    "Like a knocking, on a my bedroom door, but somewhere closer to home."
    "That's it. An ordinary knocking."
    "Bap. Bap. Bap."
    "A knock on my forehead before dawn."
    takeru "Kenta! I'm awake!"
    kenta "Good morning Takeru."
    takeru "Kenta, I swear, the sun isn't even up, what are you doing beating my head in? I was having such a pleasant dream too..."
    kenta "This is an emergency."
    takeru "Something better be on fire, Kenta, or I'm going back to sleep. It's going to be a long day so I - "
    kenta "I'm taking the measurements. The tape measure is faulty and won't stick to the door. It's a matter of inches, Takeru. I need your help."
    takeru "No you don't."
    kenta "I do."
    takeru "I give up. What are you talking about?"
    "I roll over and sit up, rubbing my wounded forehead. Kenta is waving his hands around, wielding a tape measure."
    "Checking the window, the sun isn't up. Checking the alarm, I could've slept another two hours."
    kenta "This is a crisis, Takeru."
    takeru "What?"
    kenta "I'm taking measurements of the door frame. Yesterday I wrote down the length of the new bed and cabinet I'm assembling up in the gym, and I'm afraid all of it might be too long."
    takeru "All of that junk isn't coming in here. I could tell you that without measuring. Where would I stand? Where would I sleep? You'd have to stack the beds on top of each other."
    kenta "Bunk beds, you say? Not a bad idea. Do you mind the top bunk? I'm not so great with heights. This also means I'll need to build a ladder..."
    takeru "No. No bunks. I'm not sleeping on anything you've put a nail in, no offense. Whatever you're building, just put it..."
    takeru "I don't know. Put it back where it came from after the festival is over."
    kenta "Disassemble it? That defeats the point, Takeru. Isn't that obvious? I just need to see if everything fits through the door, and after that, I'll be able to organize everything. But if it's too small, then, well, then..."
    takeru "Okay. I'll help you measure. Let me wake up and then tell me what needs doing."
    "Kenta extends the tape measure and passes me one end. It looks like the metal part at the end has snapped off, so measuring anything with this broken tool is a two man job."
    kenta "Stand on the other side of the door. There! That's good."
    takeru "Please don't fit, please don't fit..."
    kenta "Excellent. The door is 40 inches wide, and then the base frame is 80 inches, and the angle..."
    takeru "What's that paper you're scribbling on?"
    kenta "It's a diagram of our room. To fit in, the angle and the length need to add together here such that - "
    takeru "This looks really complicated. Instead of putting this whole math problem together why didn't you just measure in the first place?"
    kenta "It's very obvious, Takeru. I'm sure you already know that."
    "No, I don't really. Clearly this is some Kenta-logic that defies my simple mind."
    "Instead I'll just watch him puzzle this one out."
    "He scratches his head with the pencil. I sit down and yawn. Finally, Kenta turns to me. His face is white."
    kenta "It's a disaster."
    takeru "It doesn't fit? I'm heartbroken. Guess we have to find someplace else to put all your new furniture. That's too bad."
    kenta "Terrible. Just terrible."
    takeru "Yep. I'm going back to bed."
    kenta "How are we supposed to squeeze this through the door? Even if we rotate the new bed at the optimal angle, there's still two inches."
    kenta "Takeru, you can't give up now."
    takeru "I was never trying."
    kenta "I'll fetch the saw from the Mirako gym. Let's widen the door."
    takeru "I'm not sawing a hole through our dorm doorway, Kenta."
    kenta "Takeru, you have to have an idea. You seem good at dealing with these situations. What should we do?"
    takeru "There's no 'we' here. The question is what you should do."
    takeru "And my solution is to go back to sleep. Let's deal with this later today. I already told you there's no room in here, so let's figure it out later today."
    kenta "Alright. How am I supposed to sleep with this on my mind? This is a huge problem."
    kenta "Besides, I've already allocated out two hours this morning to figuring out the solution."
    "He waves a sheet of paper at me. I recognize it as one of Kenta's timetables. Did he seriously block out two hours the morning of the festival to figure out what to do with all his woodworking? Unbelievable."
    "Of course, with Kenta worrying aloud, it's impossible for me to get back to sleep. I get ready for the day ahead about two hours ahead of what I had planned."
    "Guess today might be a bit stressful after all, with Kenta following me around like this. He still won't settle down about the furniture."
    kenta "The two hours are almost over and we still haven't figured this out. I have a bed up there. I have two cabinets up there. What am I supposed to do with the desk? How about the nightstand?"
    takeru "Let's just go to the festival, Kenta. We'll figure it out later."
    "I think I drift off somewhere in the next few minutes. By reflex, I roll left. Then right. But finally a blow from Kenta catches me square in the forehead and I'm forced to admit defeat. There will be no more sleep this morning."
    takeru "Fine... Let's get going."
    "I dress myself in the morning haze."
    "Kenta's worried babbling washes over me, but I'm more concerned about what else is supposed to happen today to commisserate with his door dimension problems."
    "I'm worried if something will happen to Hikari, partially. And I'm not sure how Hagami's performance will go. But all the same, I'm looking forward to today, whether Kenta was his measurements straight or not."
    takeru "Are you ready to go?"
    kenta "No. Takeru, we still haven't - "
    takeru "Oh yeah, I forgot. We're supposed to meet up with Natsumi and Meiko for today. Remember?"
    kenta "Natsumi?"
    takeru "Oh come on. Baseball captain, school idol..."
    kenta "I don't know her."
    takeru "She's the one that always yells 'Hey!' at you and acts like she's your best friend."
    kenta "Oh her. I don't have any time in the schedule for her nonsense."
    takeru "It's not my plan. Tell that to Natsumi."
    kenta "Who?"
    "Yep. It's going to be an interesting day."
    
    "We start the walk to school."
    "For the early hour, it's surprising how many other students are up and about. No one seems to be alone, either. Pockets of other people I recognize are making their way towards Mirako, talking excitedly amongst themselves."
    "There are also people I don't recognize. There's some couples only a few years older than us, families with small children, and I even spot several old men that'd look more at place at a mahjong table making their way up the hill."
    "These must be early comers to the festival."
    "Tohoku never had a school cultural festival so I don't really have any point of references. For us, our games were the main attraction. Whenever we had a playoff game, or a game against our divisional rivals, we'd get an audience from all over town, plus the odd reporter."
    "That's what this reminds me off. Where Tohoku had its baseball, Mirako has its festival. At least this time, there's no pressure on me to perform. I'm just here to enjoy the day like everyone else."
    "Or at least, that's what I was planning. Kenta seems to have other ideas."
    kenta "Have you thought of anything yet?"
    takeru "Anything what?"
    kenta "The furniture, of course. Takeru, what am I supposed to do with my carpentry booth? How are we going to get all of that back to the dorm."
    takeru "You've really got a single track mind."
    kenta "It's printed right here. I had two hours to take the measurements and figure this out. Now I'm behind. I'm behind, Takeru. I don't like to be behind so I've got to figure out what to do."
    takeru "As long as I don't end up in a bunk bed, I've got bigger things to worry about."
    "I can't convince him."
    "My patience is tested as we keep walking. I'm tempted to lie and tell him the tape measure was wrong and we can take all those extra beds in the first place. But I just know it would end up with me sandwiched between two pieces of wood while Kenta called it 'organized.'"
    "We're about halfway to Mirako before we pass the gap. At first glance it's nothing special, but this is the spot between the two guardrails where there's an overlook to the valley beyond."
    "Meiko and I have stopped here a few times, but it's not a place I notice on my daily commute. Today, I only hesitate because there's a girl standing there. Her back is to me, but I think I recognize her. When I stop short, Kenta bumps into me."
    kenta "Takeru? What are you doing? At least apologize when you - "
    takeru "Mana? Is that you?"
    mana "Takeru, it's you! Takeru! Hey Takeru!"
    takeru "Er, hi."
    mana "I can't believe it, I screwed up, I screwed up. I was supposed to get the prize together for the swim team, and now..."
    mana "Sorry."
    mana "Good morning! It's good to see you! You're going to the festival?"
    takeru "Yeah. You said you'd be really angry if I didn't, right?"
    mana "Yep! I'd be so mad! You wouldn't even know what hit you! You've got to show up for Hagami's recital today! And if you missed the swim team's fundraiser..."
    mana "Oh... If there even is a fundraiser now..."
    takeru "What's going on? What is that you're holding?"
    "I think she has a plate in her hands. Or at least it looks like a plate. Except I don't know why Mana would stack a bunch of black rocks on such a nice looking white porcelain plate. Then I realize the black chunks look more like ash than rock."
    mana "It's my cake! Would you like a slice?"
    kenta "Cake? That's a cinder on a platter."
    mana "Oh no. Is it that obvious? I burned it a bit last night... I didn't think it was that bad!"
    takeru "Kenta, be polite."
    kenta "Honesty is more important than manners. Who are you, anyway?"
    takeru "Kenta, this is my friend Mana. And Mana, this is my roommate Kenta. Haven't you met?"
    mana "Oh. You."
    kenta "'You?' Who on earth are you?"
    mana "I know you! You're Hagami's lab partner! You no-good work-shirking schedule-setting Hagami-scaring..."
    "I realize that, no, Kenta and Mana have never met. I don't think I've ever seen Mana on this particular road and I always assumed she lived in town or in some other dorm."
    "Kenta doesn't seem phased. Mana is giving him the death glare, but Kenta just looks baffled. Does he honestly have no idea what she's talking about?"
    kenta "Who's Hagami?"
    mana "My friend, stupid! You were her lab partner, and you wanted to divide the work, and Hagami couldn't set up a meeting, and you kept - "
    takeru "Calm down, Mana. We worked through this, right? Everything got done in the end?"
    mana "Well yeah, but still... I can't just let this guy go! Hagami was worried sick! He - "
    takeru "It's all worked out now. Kenta, you should apologize."
    kenta "Apologize? Who are you, anyway? Who's Hagami? Have we - "
    mana "This guy's unbelievable! So insensitive! You should be grateful I don't quite know voodoo or black magic yet, mister, or else I oughta..."
    takeru "Okay, never mind. Let's move on. Mana, what on earth is that you're carrying?"
    mana "It's one of the prizes for the swimming club raffle."
    takeru "Er... You'll have to narrow it down."
    "Kenta is also eyeing the plate suspiciously. I'm not sure if Mana actually tried to bake something, or else just shuffled a generous portion of volcanic ash onto a cake platter."
    mana "Is it really that bad?"
    kenta "Is that your idea of a dessert? You seem to have turned the temperature too high, or else left in to bake too long. It is distinctly inedible. I advise - "
    mana "I don't care about your advice! I worked hard on this cake! It's the grand prize in the swimming club fundraising raffle!"
    mana "Takeru... You'd eat it, wouldn't you?"
    takeru "Er..."
    mana "Really?"
    takeru "I don't mean to offend you, but, er..."
    "Mana sighs."
    mana "I knew it was bad. This isn't good, Takeru! I'm supposed to have the prize ready to go for the raffle! The swimming club is putting on a fundraiser for the festival and I'm in charge of the grand prize!"
    mana "Um, I might have fallen asleep and left the oven on too long, um..."
    kenta "By the charring on the sides, I estimate you should've taken the cake out an hour before you - "
    mana "I don't need to hear it from you! What am I supposed to do now? Yumi will kill me! I'll be kicked off the team for sure! I promised I'd have the most delicious, the most appetizing, the most beautiful cake they'd ever seen, and now..."
    mana "Takeru! What should I do?"
    takeru "I have no idea. I'm no chef."
    kenta "Takeru is not very good at problem solving in the morning."
    takeru "Very funny, Kenta."
    kenta "What's funny?"
    "I'm left to suffer in silence. Of course Kenta doesn't get it."
    mana "He doesn't ever seem to be that good at it, does he?"
    kenta "Unfortunately."
    takeru "That's unfair."
    kenta "Stop complaining, Takeru. I need to finish setting up the booth."
    "With nothing left to do, the three of us start heading towards Mirako."
    "Mana and Kenta keep glaring daggers at each other and I'm afraid to walk in front of them in case a fistfight breaks out."
    mana "I'm nervous. Yumi's going to kick me off the swim team for sure! And even Takeru's stumped on what to do."
    kenta "What exactly is the problem?"
    mana "Well, the cake's burnt, isn't it?"
    kenta "You can still eat the top."
    mana "That's not the point! No one's going to buy a raffle ticket for three quarters of a cake!"
    kenta "I would."
    mana "Oh really?"
    mana "Well... thanks?"
    kenta "I'd pay three quarters of the full price. That's only fair."
    mana "Close enough. Can you um, explain that to Yumi maybe?"
    kenta "No."
    mana "Why not?"
    kenta "It's not scheduled. I'm very busy today."
    "Kenta pulls out a sheet of paper. It's today's schedule, broken into fifteen minute increments of color coded blocks."
    mana "What the heck?"
    kenta "Booth setup is in ten minutes. I'm already two minutes behind schedule because you showed up with a cake, and another three minutes behind because Takeru was slow to wake up."
    takeru "Kenta, it's almost an hour before the festival even starts, you didn't need to drag me out of bed just so you could hammer a few nails or - "
    kenta "Oh please. It's more subtle than that, Takeru."
    mana "Um, Kenta, what exactly is it you're showing?"
    takeru "He assembles furniture or something."
    kenta "It's called carpentry. It's by far the top hobby in the country. Superior to collecting, even."
    kenta "Let's keep moving please. I've only allocated twenty minutes today for dealing with harassment from strangers. It's outlined here in yellow."
    mana "Geeze. Were you planning on relaxing today at all?"
    kenta "That's in green. I have half an hour before lunch. There are ten minutes before that where I have to convince Takeru to look after the booth for a bit."
    takeru "I'm not looking after your booth, Kenta. I'm meeting up with Natsumi and Meiko, and it's not like your furniture is going to grow legs and run away."
    mana "I've heard there are spells for that!"
    kenta "You can't be serious."
    mana "I'm just saying it doesn't hurt to keep an eye out. I've seen weirder things happen. So you'll keep an eye on Kenta's booth, won't you Takeru?"
    takeru "I'd probably give it all away so that junk wouldn't end up in our dorm room. I have a really bad feeling about this."
    kenta "I have an idea, Takeru. We can move everything down in front of our door, then I'll take out the screws and nails, we break everything down, then move it into the room, then reassemble it. Voile."
    takeru "Nope. Not happening."
    mana "You'd say no to free furniture? And from your roommate even?"
    takeru "Mana, if you show up while I'm guarding Kenta's booth, I will literally give you a free chair or something to take home. It's all yours."
    kenta "You. Who were you again?"
    mana "Me? I'm Mana! I told you that ten minutes ago!"
    kenta "Mana, how wide is your doorway?"
    mana "What?"
    kenta "To within two centimeters please."
    takeru "Don't answer that, Mana."
    
    "When we pass through the gates, I notice several student council members setting up a table and unloading boxes of programs."
    "Right... Meiko is probably around somewhere. I wonder if Natsumi got her to agree to take it easy for once and enjoy the festival with us."
    "No one from town is here yet. But there are plenty of classmates I recognize running around, doing some last minute setup before the festival begins in earnest."
    "Every person we pass, Mana ducks behind Kenta's broad shoulders. Is she hiding?"
    kenta "Do you need something?"
    mana "If you could stand there for just a sec..."
    kenta "Why? Why does nobody ever explain anything to me? You know everything would be a lot simpler if everyone just said what they wanted instead of - "
    mana "Eep! That's her!"
    kenta "Who?"
    mana "Yumi!"
    takeru "The swim team captain?"
    mana "If she sees me with this cake it's all over!"
    kenta "The cake is fine. Stop hiding behind me."
    "Kenta tries to sidestep her, but Mana follows him."
    kenta "I don't understand the problem."
    mana "Eeep!"
    "The girl Mana is hiding from, Yumi, is way by the school entrance, but now that Kenta is spinning in circles, apparently dancing with himself, she's looking this way."
    "I wave and try to pretend like I have half an idea of what's going on. The girl, Yumi, gives me a weird look then heads inside."
    "Probably I just embarassed myself, but mission accomplished."
    takeru "She's gone. Coast is clear, Mana."
    mana "Oh thank goodness!"
    natsumi "Hey Takeru!"
    takeru "Natsumi?"
    natsumi "And Kenta, too. What are you all dancing in circles for?"
    takeru "Long story."
    kenta "It's actually very straightforward. When I was putting together the schedule this morning, I blocked only ten minutes to wake Takeru up, when actually - "
    takeru "Like I said, - "
    mana "I swear I only set the timer for half an hour, but then when I checked, oh... It's terrible!"
    kenta "If you can't let anyone see you with it, why'd you bring it to school anyway?"
    mana "Well, um..."
    natsumi "Oh, this is going to be a great day, Takeru. I can tell already."
    takeru "The way I see it, I've got multiple problems to deal with already, and I'm going to have you hounding me all day."
    natsumi "Yep. It'll be the best kind of festival."
    takeru "What, chaos?"
    "Natsumi grins, but there's something evil in her smirk, like something from a movie villain."
    "It looks Kenta and Mana are busy enough arguing with each other that I can actually talk to her properly... if I dare."
    takeru "I surprised you're here this early."
    natsumi "I was trying to catch Meiko before she got sucked in some student council nonsense, but I haven't seen her yet. She wouldn't come late to her own festival."
    takeru "Maybe she snuck around the back road or something."
    natsumi "Why? Who'd want to avoid me?"
    "I spot Yumi from the swim team exiting Mirako, and Mana and Kenta start spinning around again."
    takeru "I don't know if I can take a full day of this."
    natsumi "Hey Kenta! What exactly are you all worked up about again?"
    kenta "I'm behind schedule. Takeru was slow to wake up..."
    takeru "Two hour earlier than necessary."
    kenta "...and the measurements are off. I only have an hour to figure this out."
    takeru "He means the furniture measurements."
    kenta "They won't fit through the door."
    takeru "He means the door to our dorm. He wants to move all the furniture back into the room because I guess he'd prefer a piece of wood as a roommate."
    kenta "There's room enough for both you and the furniture, Takeru. I'm a very good organizer. How far off the floor are you comfortable sleeping?"
    natsumi "I see the problem."
    "Natsumi turns to Mana."
    natsumi "How about you?"
    mana "Thank you! Thank you so much! You got that guy to actually stand still so I could hide. I think she's gone. Takeru, is she gone?"
    takeru "Yumi? Yeah she went back inside."
    natsumi "Uhh, that's not supposed to be a cake, is it?"
    mana "Well..."
    natsumi "You're Takeru's friend? Have we met?"
    mana "I'm M-Mana, I'm on the swim team, it's my first year here."
    natsumi "Hey. I'm - "
    mana "I know who you are. You're only the most popular girl in the school! The baseball star!"
    kenta "Oh, you've heard of this girl before? What's her name again?"
    natsumi "Kenta, you joker. Mana, you should get along with Kenta. He's the funniest guy at Mirako!"
    kenta "No really, can you help me out here?"
    natsumi "Yeah, easy. You don't know what to do with the furniture, so we'll have to come up with something..."
    kenta "That's not what I meant. And I know what do with the furniture. Takeru is sleeping on most of it. The door is the problem."
    takeru "Kenta, when did you want to finish setting up your booth?"
    kenta "I almost forgot! Kenta I'll have to talk to you later."
    mana "Wait up! Hold still! Get back here!"
    "Kenta walks off. Mana, still holding her singed cake, has to run to keep up."
    "Natsumi gives me a weird look."
    natsumi "So, about that promise... You did say you'd hang out with me and Meiko today, so - "
    takeru "That took care of them though, right?"
    natsumi "I feel guilty though."
    takeru "Really? I didn't know that was possible for you."
    natsumi "Come on Takeru, I know it's stupid early but don't be so crabby. Let's go bail them out."
    takeru "Bail them out?"
    natsumi "I bet I can fix this. Just you watch."
    takeru "Anything so I don't have to sleep on a Kenta-made four poster bed. Let's go."
    
    "Kenta must really be behind schedule. Plenty of students are milling around the gym, setting up, but I notice one or two elderly people as well. They must be early risers from Mirako, here early to check out the festival."
    "I guess the gates must already be open."
    "As we nagivate through the rows of booths in the gym, I'm struck by just how many of my classmates are participating. There was definitely never anything like this at Tohoku."
    takeru "So how come the baseball team doesn't have a display or something set up?"
    natsumi "Booo. Come on, Takeru. We weren't expecting to be here today."
    takeru "Oh right. The tournament, and all."
    natsumi "I'm not too hung up about it any more. It means I can at least enjoy myself today."
    natsumi "Or try to, anyway. If Meiko would show up. And your crazy friends would calm down a bit."
    "Natsumi points to the corner of the gym where Kenta has his cabinets set up. I spot a slightly charred cake on top of a display stand, and Mana hiding behind some shelves. Kenta is armed with a tape measure and keeps flailing his arms everywhere."
    takeru "I don't know how well you know Kenta, but..."
    natsumi "I know him plenty well. Watch this. Learn from the master."
    natsumi "Hey Kenta!"
    kenta "Good morning."
    natsumi "Let's take care of the furniture problem."
    kenta "You're here to help?"
    takeru "She says that..."
    kenta "Oh Kenta, you're here too. Can you hold this - "
    takeru "Nope."
    mana "Takeru! You can't be so cruel to your roommate!"
    takeru "Alright Kenta. What is it this time?"
    kenta "The glue is setting on this one, so just push these two boards together."
    takeru "Got it. How long?"
    kenta "Thirty three minutes."
    takeru "Dammit."
    takeru "Natsumi, what are you writing on that sign?"
    natsumi "It's the advertising."
    mana "For what?"
    natsumi "Our silent auction."
    takeru "What? Let me see that."
    kenta "Takeru, you need to hold still. What's on that sign?"
    "Natsumi has a big posterboard salvaged from somewhere and a permanent marker so large I can smell it even from my position in the middle of Kenta's handcrafted furniture."
    "She props up the poster against a cabinet while Kenta, Mana and I all stare."
    takeru "'Endou Kenta's Bespoke Woodcraftery -- Silent Auction, Today Only'"
    kenta "What's a silent auction?"
    mana "What's a bespoke?"
    natsumi "Easy. Everyone comes by and sees some desks and some buzzwords. Then they put down how much they're willing to pay for each item. At the end of the day, the highest bidder wins."
    kenta "You're giving away my furniture!"
    natsumi "Selling it. Think of it this way... You can take that cash and find a new hobby. Weren't you into taxidermy last year?"
    kenta "But I had to stop because the animals were too expensive... Hm..."
    takeru "No more dead animals in the room, Kenta, I'm begging you. The frogs were one thing, but - "
    natsumi "It's the Mirako student festival. You've got all day to find a club or a hobby or something. Take your pick. I guarantee you someone's going to buy this stuff. I'll even put my name down."
    "Within a few minutes, all of Kenta's fleet of wooden constructions have a clipboard and box in front of them, courtesy of Natsumi. I guess she's craftier than I thought."
    kenta "I suppose this works. As much as it hurts to part with my cabinets..."
    natsumi "Really it's Takeru who should be thanking be, or else he'd be sleeping under one of these desks I'd bet. You know, I'd like to see that."
    takeru "Very funny."
    kenta "Takeru, do you want to go look around the stands? I need to find somewhere to invest my proceeds, after all."
    takeru "I thought you wanted me holding this board for another ten minutes."
    kenta "Twelve minutes, actually."
    mana "I'll come!"
    takeru "Weren't you hiding here from somebody?"
    mana "Oh! That's right! I almost forgot!"
    natsumi "Who is this that you're so terrified?"
    mana "Y-Yumi! She's the captain of the swimming team, and if I don't have our raffle prize, she, she'll..."
    natsumi "Let's see..."
    natsumi "Kenta, help me carry this desk."
    kenta "The desk? Where are we taking the desk? You're a very presumptuous person, showing up here and bossing us around. Takeru, where do you find these friends of yours?"
    natsumi "Mana, lead the way."
    mana "Me? Where?"
    natsumi "The swim team booth."
    mana "But Yumi's gonna kill me! I promised a top notch prize, and now I have - "
    natsumi "And now you have a custom-made 100% genuine Endou desk. It's the new top prize. Let's go."
    kenta "You're just giving away my desk? I'm not taking it anywhere. It's going back to the dorm."
    takeru "Please no."
    natsumi "Kenta, in return you get a cake."
    kenta "A cake?"
    mana "Oh! Right! It's on the cabinet there!"
    kenta "That's three quarters of a cake at best. I question whether this trade is - "
    natsumi "Just lift the desk, Kenta."
    kenta "Good enough. Show me the way."
    mana "Over here!"
    takeru "Don't mind me. I'll just hold these two planks together for another hour. See you all later."
    kenta "It's only eight more minutes, Takeru. Please, be precise."
    takeru "Got it, got it..."

        "If I cared about time management as much as Kenta, this would seem like a miserable chore, but I'm pretty sure I could put this set of boards down now and move on with my day."
        "After a few minutes of watching elderly Mirako residents pass and ignore the auction, my arms start to ache. I'm not sure how I was supposed to time this without a clock. It seems like a waste of time anyway if this chair is already set."

        meiko "Still. I'm glad today's finally here. You should cheer up a bit, Takeru. I'm sure now that you've settled in you'll find the festival's a lot of fun."

        meiko "Alright."

        "She doesn't answer. Then again, it wasn't a question."
        hagami "Mana was worried?"
        takeru "Er, I'm not sure if she mentioned it, but I know I was. We haven't seen you all day and your performance isn't too far off."
        hagami "...She knows I don't like the festival."
        takeru "You don't?"
        hagami "It's loud. And... Lots of people."
        "Hagami grimaces."
        takeru "Oh. I guess that makes sense."
        hagami "Although... Thank you for worrying about me."
        takeru "You look exhausted. Do you at least want to grab lunch or something?"
        hagami "Not really..."
        takeru "Should I bring you something?"
        hagami "That... would be inconvenient."
        hagami "I'll come with you."
        takeru "Right."
        
        "We walk upstairs. Hopefully Hikari ran off somewhere and isn't tailing us."
        "I start towards the gym, but when we get to the open double doors with the \"Mirako High Student Cultural Festival\" banner, she balks."
        hikari "They're serving outside... Aren't they?"
        takeru "Yeah."
        "We take a detour to the fields behind Mirako. There are a few stalls set up here, but the main attraction is the grill I remember dragging up here a few weeks ago. The student council is running the cookout."
        "There are still plenty of students milling around. Actually, it looks like mostly visitors out here. A few portable tables are set up, paper tableclothes billowing in the wind. The sound of chatter carries on the breeze."
        "I notice Hagami is still a distance behind me, hesitating."
        "If I think about it, I've only ever seen her outside the old wing of Mirako on a handful of occassions, and she's always seemed out of sorts, even then. Even Hikari seems to wander out more often."
        "Now, with a thousand strangers filling the field, Hagami probably isn't too comfortable."
        takeru "I'll grab food. Do you want to find a table?"
        hagami "Alright."
        "She retreats off towards the gym entrance, at the far end of the field. Not too many people around there, I guess."
        "While wait in line to pick up our lunch, I try to keep an eye out for Meiko, but no luck. Is she busy dealing with the people from the fireworks company?"
        "It sure looks like the whole rest of the student council is here. That bespectacled guy I always see at the meetings with Meiko serves me two skewers of beef off the grill and hands me my change."
        "Hagami has her back turned as I approach the table."
        takeru "Here you go."
        hagami "Ah."
        "She accepts her food, but eats in silence."
        "Isn't there usually a book prop to break the silence? I suddenly miss Mana. Hopefully she hasn't killed Kenta yet."
        "Finally, Hagami looks up."
        hagami "Were you talking to Hikari?"
        takeru "What? Back in the old wing?"
        takeru "...Yeah."
        hagami "Have you told her?"
        "Her question is vague, but I immediately know what she means. No, no I haven't had the guts to tell Hikari that today is probably her last day on this earth.\""
        takeru "I couldn't do it. I don't know if I should."
        takeru "Er, this sounds weird, but Hikari's really nosy. She listens in on me all the time. If she followed us, she might - "
        hagami "Doesn't matter."
        hagami "You haven't told her?"
        takeru "No."
        takeru "I don't know if I should."
        "Hagami looks up."
        hagami "I knew it."
        takeru "Knew what?"
        hagami "You really care about her."
        takeru "I mean of course. She's the first person I met here. She... I don't trust anyone more than her. Of course I'm going to be upset if she forgets me, or disappears, or..."
        hagami "Is she scared?"
        takeru "No."
        hagami "Are you?"
        takeru "...Maybe."
        "She stares, with a soft, sad smile."
        "Finally, I have to look away."
        takeru "Hikari better not be listening."
        takeru "You think I should tell her then?"
        hagami "It's up to you."
        takeru "In that opera you were talking about..."
        takeru "The heroine is the ghost, right?"
        hagami "Giselle."
        takeru "And the hero is engaged to her."
        hagami "Albrecht."
        takeru "Does he know Giselle will disappear?"
        hagami "No."
        takeru "And does Giselle know?"
        hagami "No."
        hagami "...Maybe that way is more kind."
        takeru "You think?"
        hagami "I should never have said what I did."
        hagami "Sorry Takeru. I knew you... felt that way about Hikari but I've been terrible at keeping secrets, and..."
        hagami "Goodbye. I think I'd better practice."
        takeru "Hagami! Hey, wait a second."
        "Hagami rises from her seat, lunch half finished."
        hagami "You'll watch the recital?"
        takeru "For sure. But don't you want to - "
        hagami "I'll see you then."
        "She takes a few steps backwards, biting her lip. The turns and sets off on the path back around the school."
        "I probably shouldn't follow."
        "Instead, I sit at the empty table and stare after her. What did she mean? She asked me yesterday to tell Hikari the news, but..."
        "Why I am I just sitting here instead of trying to find Hikari? I know I'm the coward here. It's not indecision that has me paralyzed it's just... I don't want to believe Hagami."
        "Wherever she's got her information from, it's got to be wrong. It's just an opera, right? Fiction."
        "Something flickers in my peripheral vision. ...Or was that a someone?"
        "Hikari?"
        "Was she listening?"
        "She's followed me around before to listen in..."
        "No, couldn't have been her."
        "I stand up."
        takeru "Enough of this."
        "I'll find Hikari. I'll tell her what Hagami thinks. Definitely nothing will happen. We'll watch the fireworks together, and nothing will happen..."
        "...is what I want to think."
        "Actually I don't want to do much thinking at all at the moment. I stretch."
        "I need to find Natsumi, or Kenta, or someone. I can't sit here and argue with myself in my head forever. Instead I'll go find Kenta and argue about the price of whittling knives or something. Much better."
        
        "I've only taken about three steps into the gym when I hear a voice."
        natsumi "Yo. Takeru!"
        takeru "Hey! What's up?"
        "Natsumi's waving and calling me over to Kenta's furniture display. One or two visitors are milling around, as well as Mana and Kenta. I join them."
        natsumi "We were putting together a battle plan."
        kenta "You were the one putting together the plan. I don't see why we have to - "
        mana "Shut up and let her explain!"
        natsumi "We have a team member that's MIA."
        takeru "MIA?"
        kenta "Missing in action. It's a military term. It's usually used to refer to soldiers who've gone missing on the battlefield, so its use in this case is wholly inappropriate, and I don't think - "
        mana "Pipe down!"
        natsumi "Meiko promised she'd be here, and it's passed lunch time, and I haven't seen her. I'll check inside the school. Mana and Kenta are searching the gym, and - "
        kenta "How am I supposed to know her if I see her? I never agreed to this. Why don't you - "
        natsumi "And Takeru! Get yourself something to eat and check outside by the fields. If you find Meiko, report back here immediately."
        takeru "I just came from lunch. And who's going to wait here at the booth?"
        natsumi "That's no big deal."
        kenta "No big deal? I fail to see how this isn't the largest deal. I've spent hours making this furniture, and putting it at risk to find your - "
        mana "Finding Natsumi's friend is way more important than your dumb chairs!"
        kenta "You're calling my furniture unintelligent? That's nonsensical. They're all made of wood so they can't be - "
        mana "Come on! Shut up! Let's go!"
        "Mana trudges off towards the gym entrance, dragging Kenta by the wrist. Kenta, for his part, protests the whole way, gesticulating a piece of paper that I'm sure must be his schedule."
        "Once they're out of earshot, Natsumi immediately stops her military instructor impression and instead doubles over laughing."
        natsumi "Look at those two!"
        takeru "They apparently hate each other."
        natsumi "You're kind of thick, Takeru. They're obviously made for each other."
        takeru "I can't think of two people in the world that are more different. They bicker constantly."
        natsumi "Oh come one. It's really funny. And you and I argue all the time but that doesn't mean - "
        takeru "For one thing, we don't argue, really. I just yell at you when you do something obnoxious like try to trick me into joining your baseball team."
        natsumi "Fair enough."
        takeru "And second, no, we're not made for each other."
        natsumi "At least humor me a bit, Takeru. Come on."
        takeru "No."
        natsumi "Fiiine. At least come help me look for Meiko. I bet I know where she's holed up."
        takeru "Alright, I can do that."
        natsumi "Ha! Got you to compromise!"
        takeru "Yep, congratulations. Now where to?"
        natsumi "Just outside here. I can feel it."
        takeru "And you're just going to leave Kenta's booth?"
        natsumi "There's only an hour or two left on the silent auction anyway. We've got plenty of bids. Let's go."
        "She points towards the access door at the corner of the gym."
        takeru "Right. The shrine..."
        natsumi "Yeah. Are you coming or what?"
        "We walk through a few aisles of stands, student displays, and tables arrayed with posters and signs for Mirako clubs. Everyone waves at Natsumi. A guy from the literature club chats her up and passes a free copy of their magazine. I mostly try to look like I know what I'm doing."
        "We keep going. At this point, half the booths are emtpy. Everyone's wandering the gym, outside in the field catching a late lunch, or out by the entrance finding friends."
        "I have to admit, it's a warm atmosphere. Every person she greets, Natsumi has a huge smile on her face. I can see why. She tries introducing me to a student council member, and then to a senior on the baseball team, but I can hardly remember names. I just bow and say my hellos."
        "Finally, we work our way out of the gym and into the sunlight."
        natsumi "Now let's see..."
        "There are one or two student display booths out by this corner of the school. One looks to be the robotics club, with a poster and small RC vehicle set up on a table, the students long since left to hang out somewhere else. On the other side, a few feet away, is a shrine."
        "That's... Meiko's, right? To Hikari. I was here yesterday."
        "At first, it looks as empty as the rest of the tables, but then I spot movement behind it."
        natsumi "Meiko? Hey! Meiko!"
        "Meiko pops up from front of shrine."
        meiko "Hello."
        natsumi "Why's everyone hiding today? Seriously. I've been looking for you half the day."
        meiko "Sorry. I needed to put the finishing touches on the shrine before the afternoon program starts. And all morning I was meeting with the company for the - "
        "She looks at me. Fireworks, right? I guess Natsumi doesn't know about that yet."
        meiko "There's a surprise this evening I had to set up."
        natsumi "A surprise? I knew it."
        "Natsumi flips open the festival pamphlet."
        natsumi "Speeches from the student council, huh? No one would ever sit through something that boring. It's an obvious fake. This can only mean..."
        natsumi "Fireworks!"
        "Natsumi fistpumps."
        meiko "You have to keep it quiet."
        natsumi "I'll take it to the grave."

        "Hikari watches them run off."
        hikari "That's your roommate?"
        takeru "Yep."
        hikari "And that's your club president."
        takeru "Yep."
        hikari "Takeru, we have to talk."
        takeru "Natsumi's trying to get them to kill each other I think."
        hikari "You don't seem too concerned."
        takeru "Better than the alternative. Actually, can you make sure when they're back, you really sell Kenta on the whole carving thing? If Mana gets him hooked on voodoo or black magic or something..."
        takeru "Or ghost hunting..."
        hikari "Got it. We don't want anyone wandering around the school at night in cultist robes. Except for you, of course."
        takeru "Let's please just pretend that never happened."
        hikari "You may just get your wish. My brain is a sieve at this point."
        takeru "Sorry. I should've phrased that better."
        hikari "Everyone who comes to this table has the same reaction as Natsumi. They say they've seen this or that before, or sometimes they recognize my face. I remember some of them, sometimes."
        hikari "Never any names. Just, that one helped me to the nurse's office once, that one used to walk home with me... That sort of thing."
        "It sounds terrible, although Hikari doesn't seem too torn up about it. I think she's scanning the crowd."
        hikari "Oh, him. I think I met him on my first day here. Of course, he doesn't look twice at me."
        takeru "I know it must be painful. I - "
        hikari "It's not great, but hiding in plain sight suits me. I spent too long hiding in that dark room to realize no one would care if I just wandered around like my old self."
        hikari "I might as well enjoy it while it lasts."
        takeru "While... it lasts..."
        "There's no way she heard Hagami talking to me last night, right? She should think that tonight, at the fireworks, all her lost memories will come back, so..."
        hikari "You look like a fly flew down your throat, Takeru."
        takeru "Er..."
        "No point hiding it. If Hagami couldn't break the news, it falls to me."
        takeru "This might be kind of important. Do you want to grab lunch?"
        hikari "I can't exactly eat, if you remember. But I'll go for a walk."
        takeru "Will your stand be okay?"
        hikari "I don't exactly need money, either. And people seem to think that being dead means they can just take my things as they please. Did you know someone stole my chess set again? If it was Mana..."
        takeru "Er... Maybe I should show you."
        "We weave through the aisle towards the back of the gym, pressing past the heavy traffic that seems everywhere. The festival must be in full swing."
        "There are posters and flags everywhere, advertising clubs, food, contests, art and more. Groups of Mirako students and families from town wander up and down, talking, waving, laughing."
        "I recognize the industrial grill I lugged up the hill two weeks ago. Through the open loading dock, that stern-faced guy with glasses from the student council is manning the spatula, but the smell is delicious."
        "We reach the back exit. The tables out here are mostly empty, and the closest people in sight are a few hundred feet away, waiting in line for an early lunch. The only object of note is the shrine, tucked just to the side of the path."
        hikari "That's my chess set all right. And I carved that board myself, too. What exactly is..."
        "I think she can probably tell."
        "The doors of the shrine are open, but no picture of Hikari anywhere to be found. There are, however, two lit candles, and a pale blue book titled \"In Memoriam.\" Hikari flips it open. Looks like the idea is that visitors write their respects inside."
        "She immediately closes it. I catch a glimpse of a page of clear, bold handwriting that could only belong to Meiko."
        hikari "I get it."
        hikari "Takeru, who built this?"
        "She doesn't sound happy."
        takeru "Meiko. She brought the chess pieces out here because she wanted to include something you used to own."
        hikari "Used to own? I still own them. Really..."
        "She grits her teeth."
        hikari "At least someone remembers me. Meiko... Not that I remember anything but her name."
        takeru "Sorry."
        hikari "It's fine. I have you and Hagami and Mana to watch the fireworks tonight. I've sort of given up on remembering anything of who I was last year."
        takeru "Y-you know... But Hagami said..."
        hikari "Don't get all uptight, Takeru. You're terrible at hiding your emotions, seriously..."
        hikari "She only said that whole thing about the opera and the white lady and all that nonsense because Mana was there. She couldn't let down her friend. I honestly think if I evaporated in front of them, Mana would be more torn up about it than me."
        hikari "Did she make the whole opera story up out of thin air? Hagami's more inventive than I thought."
        takeru "It..."
        "Then Hikari doesn't know. She guessed that there's no miracle coming up with the fireworks tonight, but she doesn't know the whole truth of it."
        takeru "She sort of... bent the truth. After the fireworks, er..."
        hikari "What? Do I watch the fireworks and turn into the swan princess? I really do evaporate and terrify Mana?"
        takeru "..."
        hikari "Well."
        "Hikari looks lost for a moment, then gives a bitter laugh."
        hikari "You mean I really do evaporate?"
        takeru "That's what Hagami thinks. That's the way her opera ends, anyway... The heroine gives it one last hurrah, and that's it, she's gone."
        takeru "I think it's garbage. Hagami said it was only fiction anyway. You're a real person, not - "
        hikari "Ohh, she's right, she's right!"
        "Hikari grins."
        hikari "That fits. I bet you Hagami's theory is right."
        takeru "What are you talking about? You realize if she's right, this is something like your last day on earth!"
        hikari "Exactly. What was I missing my first go around? I remember I was happy here, and it looks like I had plenty of friends..."
        "She thumbs picks up the memorial book again and thumbs through the pages."
        hikari "...So all I was missing was the finale. By some cosmic mistake I'm still here, so I'm supposed to take the chance to finish strong. I'll watch the fireworks and take my bow."
        takeru "You can't just give up!"
        "I swallow hard. I guess the reality of it hadn't set in before. If this really is her last day, then, that makes now, with Hikari, possibly my last..."
        hikari "Don't get weepy, Takeru. Save that for Mana."
        takeru "Sorry, I don't - "
        hikari "Maybe Hagami's totally off. We don't know for sure, but if she's right, then I'm prepared for the worst. That's all, Takeru."
        hikari "I told you last night I just want to make the best of it. I'm sick of lurking and hiding, and now even tailing people around is starting to lose its novelty."
        takeru "Hikari, please, you have to... If you feel that you're..."
        hikari "See you later."
        takeru "What?"
        
        "I blinked and suddenly I'm looking in the wrong spot. Hikari was standing by the shrine, but now there's nobody there. Then where... I turn around but I don't find who I expect."
        meiko "Hello, Takeru."
        takeru "Meiko!"
        meiko "You sound surprised. I hope you're not upset to see me."
        takeru "Er, no nothing like that."
        meiko "I came to check on the shrine, but it looks like you've found it."
        "She looks at the blue book on the table, open to the middle where Hikari left it."
        meiko "...You didn't - "
        takeru "I wasn't looking through it, no."
        "I remember those full pages in the first pages. That's probably what Meiko's worried about. While I watch, she picks up the book and starts reading the entries."
        meiko "Even if you did..."
        meiko "I'd prefer if you didn't tell anyone what's in there. It's not really who I am any more... Although, I don't know why I'm fine with your knowing, really. It's hard to keep a secret from you, Takeru."
        takeru "Really?"
        meiko "You trust me, so I find it hard not to trust you."
        meiko "...You do trust me, don't you?"
        takeru "I... honestly don't know. I think."
        "She turns her head. I'm not sure how to read it at all. Is she hurt?\""
        takeru "Right, like there. I don't know why you asked me that, and I don't know how you took my answer."
        takeru "I got the complete wrong idea about you, twice, and you managed to so thoroughly confuse me about it that I don't know what to think so now I'm just assuming you're being straight with me."
        meiko "I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was that untrustworthy."
        takeru "It's more like... If you were trying to fool me, there's no way I'd know, so I gave up trying to tell. Now I'm just honest. Like I'm sure I sound like an idiot right now and I know I'm rambling, but before I would've just said 'yes' or something and..."
        "Meiko laughs."
        takeru "You're extremely hard to understand."
        meiko "Really? I'm fairly ordinary. Good grades, class rep, student council. Most people understand me right away."
        takeru "Come on. And you're out here by this shrine because you can't stand your own festival."
        "She sighs."
        meiko "I'm glad there's at least someone that can see through me..."
        takeru "I really can't. I'd only guess because you told me."
        meiko "It's the same thing, is what I mean. I feel like I can tell you, and I don't know why."
        meiko "I'm not sure I really understand why you tolerate my hanging around either, but I'll trust you."
        "She pages the memorial book to the first page, where her own writing starts."
        meiko "Hikari was the probably the only other person that really saw, well, some part of me that was me and not just a perfect model student. I met her my first day here, when I knew almost know one else..."
        meiko "When I lost her it felt like every day I was on the verge of... reverting, having to start all over. So I turned into someone who could mourn a friend, move on, respect her, and have some dignity about it."
        meiko "I still miss her."
        "Meiko looks me in the eyes, but I can't tell what she's asking."
        meiko "You say you trust me, then..."
        meiko "How did you know her?"
        "...It's an impossible question."
        "I could tell her I just saw Hikari less than ten minutes ago, and she ran away as soon as she saw Meiko. And then when I started talking about ghosts or spirits or dopplegangers or whatever Hikari is, then Meiko would think I'm well and truly crazy."
        "Yet here I am, in front of Hikari's shrine. I knew where her chess set was stashed. I knew she always wanted to see the fireworks. From Meiko's perspective, I'm sure it looks like I knew her."
        takeru "I didn't. I'm sure she a great person."
        meiko "Hm."
        "She puts the book down. There's no indication if she believes me."
        meiko "Have you eaten yet? We should find lunch before they're all out."
        takeru "I'm starving, actually. Sounds good."
        
        "Instead of heading back inside, we walk around the back of the school, past the path to the fields, to where the grill is set up in the back. Students and townspeople pass in and out of the open loading dock to the gym, passing under another colorful festival banner."
        "Plastic tables are set up all around the area, some with piles of programs on them, others with student-made sculptures or art with tags underneath explaining the piece."
        "With food, we sit down at an empty table by the entrance. I try to surreptitiously survey the area for any sign of Hikari, but thankfully she seems to have gone somewhere else. I wonder... If Hikari showed up in front of Meiko, Meiko would certainly recognize her... Right?"
        meiko "Are you alright? You look a bit spaced out."
        takeru "Oh. Sorry. Just, er, overwhelmed by the festival a bit is all."
        meiko "I know what you mean. I've been able to slip out so far but in a few hours I'll have to to help supervise the stage setup. No getting around that."
        takeru "How is Kenta's auction going?"
        meiko "There was decent business. Although everyone I know was asking what exactly I was doing there..."
        meiko "Natsumi's bizarre sign wasn't helping anything."
        takeru "Oh. Sorry, yeah, I forgot about that."
        meiko "It's fine. I left her in charge when I came out to find you."
        takeru "It sounds dangerous to put her in charge of a furniture auction, let alone a baseball team..."
        meiko "Let her goof around a bit. After the tournament this week, I think she could use just as much of a break as the rest of us. Try to humor her at least a little."
        takeru "She's going to be a terror if she gets wind of the fireworks..."
        natsumi "Hey!"
        takeru "Oh no."
        natsumi "Meiko! Takeru!"
        "She's waving and coming this way with a paper plate."
        natsumi "Who'd have thought I'd find you two out here? You don't mind if I crash, right?"
        takeru "Fine."
        meiko "Hello Natsumi. I've been hoping to see you all morning and it seems we keep missing each other."
        natsumi "Yeah, weird how that happens. I'm pretty sure I remember you promising to hang out with both me and Takeru, not just Takeru."
        takeru "You're really laying it on thick."
        natsumi "The festival's my favorite day of the year. It'll be yours soon too. And it's Meiko's favorite as well."
        meiko "I've been looking foward to this all year, and now I'm really enjoying myself. There's lots to take care of, of course, but it makes me proud to be a student here."
        natsumi "See Takeru? School pride."
        takeru "...Right."
        "I wonder if Natsumi has ever noticed if Meiko isn't completely straight with her. That was a lie, right? When Meiko said she'd been looking forward to the festival?"
        meiko "How's Kenta?"
        natsumi "Oh, him? I left him with Mana to man the auction. I've got a plan, you see."
        "Natsumi arches her fingers."
        natsumi "One, I get to come out here and eat before the wait for lunch gets too long..."
        meiko "It looks like line's into the gym already."
        natsumi "Two, I get to hunt down you two, because Takeru I know you're avoiding me."
        takeru "Then quit stalking me."
        natsumi "And three, it means Kenta and Mana will now have to get lunch together when their shift is done."
        takeru "If they murder each other I'm holding you responsible."
        natsumi "Oh don't worry, that won't happen. Probably."
        takeru "Please don't plan anything ever again."
        natsumi "Hey Takeru, show a little gratitude. I'm the reason you're not gonna spend tonight moving Kenta's furniture into your tiny dorm room."
        takeru "Okay, I concede that point."
        natsumi "Good."
        meiko "Takeru and I can look after the booth so they can go eat."
        natsumi "It should be fine. The whole point of a silent auction is that there doesn't have to be someone standing there the whole time."
        takeru "...Then what exactly are Kenta and Mana doing there now?"
        natsumi "Who knows? They're only there because I told them to."
        "She cackles."
        natsumi "Maybe we should check up on them. Bets on which one snaps first?"
        takeru "Hey, I thought you said there was no murder in the cards."
        natsumi "I'm joking, I'm joking."
        takeru "Remind me never to cross you."
        meiko "Haha, Takeru, be glad you didn't try to skip out on Natsumi today."
        takeru "No kidding..."
        natsumi "Yeah. We've got a lot of ground to cover today. Meiko, how long to you have free before the student council sends a search and rescue team?"
        meiko "Well technically..."
        "Technically there's ten other places she should be than at this table with us."
        meiko "Hm... I need to duck out before the afternoon program starts up. The principal asked me to speak, so of course I couldn't turn him, down, and I need to talk with the company coming tonight for - "
        meiko "Um..."
        "Right, Meiko doesn't know that the fireworks are back on."
        natsumi "Coming tonight for...?"
        meiko "It's a surprise?"
        natsumi "Okay, when is this surprise? It wouldn't happen to be..."
        "She flips open the festival program to the last page."
        natsumi "Right here? During this thing? 'Speeches from the student council?'"
        meiko "You might be correct."
        natsumi "Knew it!"
        "Natsumi fist pumps."
        takeru "You knew what now?"
        natsumi "It's fireworks, you dope. They're surprise rescheduling them. Nobody in their right mind would schedule student speeches as the finale for the Mirako school festival. No offense, Meiko."
        meiko "None taken. I can't compete with fireworks."
        natsumi "Ha! She even admits it. How long were you gonna keep this a secret from me and Takeru, Meiko?"
        takeru "Hey, I already knew."
        natsumi "What? And you didn't tell me? Takeru, why do I bother with you at all?"
        takeru "Stop hitting me with the program. It's called a secret for a reason."
        meiko "Try not to spread that around please."
        natsumi "I'll take it to grave."
        natsumi "Man, this is going to be one hell of a show."

        mana "Me? Tedious? You're the guy with a schedule in fifteen minute increments! You're the guy whose idea of a fun time is gluing some wood together! And you've got the gall to call me tedious? I swear I'll - "
        "Mana stamps her foot but Kenta just ignores her."
        kenta "Excuse me, how long have you been carving figurines?"
        hikari "Me? Probably two years now. Although it might be closer to three, depending on your philosphies about the afterlife."
        kenta "Hm... I'm generally twice as skilled as the average person, and with all due respect your work is decidedly amateurish, so I guess I'll be able to pick the skill up in six months. That seems reasonable."
        mana "You! Hey! Kenta, you can't just ignore me!"
        hikari "...Maybe you could ignore me, next time."
        takeru "Give him a break, Mana. I know Kenta acts like an idiot but his heart's in the right place."
        kenta "Thank you for your understanding, Takeru. Now if you'll excuse me, I was talking to this girl about a carving, a hobby that we'll soon share."

        mana "And you're not much better, Takeru. You're really gonna take his side?"
        takeru "I'm on the side of peace and quiet. Come on, let's leave them be."
        "I gesture for Mana to follow me away from Hikari's booth, and she follows, but makes a point of scowling and crossing her arms at me."
        "Hikari shoots me a glare as well... She doesn't look too thrilled to be left with Kenta, but I get the feeling that if I don't seperate them, they'll engage in a duel to the death and I don't want either of their lives on my consceince."
        mana "I don't know how you live with that guy, I swear..."
        takeru "It takes some getting used to, but I think he's just honest more than anything."

        "She punches me in the shoulder."
        takeru "Hey, I didn't say I wouldn't eat it!"

        takeru "Where is she anyway?"
        mana "Um, well..."
        "School festivals probably aren't her deal, but if she's performing, I would've assumed Hagami would've at least shown up by now."
        mana "She told me she didn't come last year..."
        takeru "Well she obviously has to come this year."
        mana "She also told me not to wait up for her..."
        takeru "Then when is she coming?"
        mana "I don't know. She didn't tell you?"
        takeru "Tell me? No. You're her best friend, right?"
        mana "I guess..."
        "Mana has her lips pursed and looks uncharacteristically withdrawn."
        mana "She said not to worry... I know she's alright though! I hope? Isn't she nervous?"

        mana "Find her? She's probably back at - "
        takeru "No, I bet I know where she is."

        takeru "It's your call then. You've known her longer."
        mana "Well... I know she always gets upset when I worry about her... And it's not hard to tell when she's lying because she thinks I'll get too upset about whatever she's dealing with..."

        mana "Kenta! What are you butting in for? And it's not the morning any more anyway!"
        kenta "Good afternoon, Mana."
        kenta "Takeru, that friend of yours with the carving booth is a little strange. She seems to be quite discourteous and doesn't understand social norms."
        mana "Social norms!? Takeru and I were having a private conversation here! Why don't you - "
        takeru "Hey Kenta, how long was that chair supposed to set? When I left Natsumi at your table, she said she was going to hold it for another half hour."
        kenta "That's ridiculous. If she's going to be there that long, it would be more time efficient to find a clamp. That's very irresponsible of her, and you Takeru. I would've thought you could remember simple wood glue times."
        takeru "Sorry Kenta. It just slipped my mind."
        kenta "I'll wait to see the finished product, but I could consider forgiving you."
        takeru "That's great. Natsumi's probably done by now though, right?"
        kenta "Good point. I'll go check on her. Thanks, Takeru!"
        "Kenta nods at me and runs off. Mana is still red in the face though, and I have to grab her shoulder to prevent her from running after him."
        mana "That guy's a menace! I've gotta go deal with him!"
        takeru "Let Natsumi deal with it. She deserves it for setting all this up... Man, she's annoyingly clever..."
        mana "Setting what up?"
        takeru "Natsumi has some, er, weird ideas. Never mind, though. We should go find Hagami, right?"
        mana "Yeah! I'd be a bad friend if I forgot about her. If she's here we'll have to make sure she gets lunch and everything!"
        
        "The school is sunny today. I guess I've never noticed between classes, when the halls are full of people, but the floor to ceiling glass windows do light the place up. I lead the way and Mana follows behind."
        "When we reach the old wing, the light becomes filtered and the chattering of the crowded gym dies away somewhat. Everything is muted down here."
        "We pass by the tea room, then on the right, the piano room comes into view. It's hard to tell if it's occupied, but if I know Hagami at all, she'll be hear, practicing. But... Then shouldn't I hear something right?"
        "Mana doesn't seem to share my worry though. She brushes by me and slides open the door."
        mana "Hagami?"
        hagami "...?"
        mana "I knew you'd be here!"
        hagami "Mana... You... I didn't think..."
        "She's sitting at the piano stool, but even when we entered, she facing towards the door, not the piano."
        hagami "Ah."
        "Hagami offers me a weak smile, and it's only then I realize we're probably intruding."
        takeru "Hey..."
        hagami "Ah. You too..."
        hagami "That makes more sense."
        "She finally stands up."
        hagami "You were worried?"
        takeru "I'm sure you'll be fine, but, er..."
        "It's hard to know how much to say with Mana there. According to Hagami last night, she's not confident at all, but Mana is standing there smiling, as if nothing is in doubt."
        "I want to help Hagami, right? That's why I came here... But I'm not sure what I can do, really, without Mana catching wind that not everything is running smoothly."
        takeru "I'm glad you came, anyway."
        hagami "I'm performing. How am I supposed to do that without coming to the festival?"
        mana "You should've told me! I would've hung out here with you instead of with Takeru's weirdo friends. Did you know he's the roommate of that horrible guy in your class? Your old lab partner? I don't believe that guy! So today, I saw Takeru on the road, and Kenta was there, and..."
        "At least Mana has a knack for defusing any situation. I take a seat on an unused table as Mana tries to summarize Kenta's oddities in under five minutes. Of course, that's an impossible task."
        "The whole time, though, Hagami keeps looking my way. I'm trying to figure out if she understands why exactly I showed up, and maybe she's trying to puzzle the same thing out. I wish there was some other way to help."
        hagami "I see..."
        mana "You get it! It's ridiculous. Takeru sent him off but I'm sure Kenta will show up again today, so if you see him, you've got to give him a piece of your mind!"
        hagami "I will, but..."
        hagami "I'm staying here. Five hours."
        mana "Five hours?"
        hagami "Until I perform. I have to be ready."
        mana "Oh. You'll do amazing Hagami! I know it! Back then, you were so amazing, and I'm sure everyone at Mirako will be thrilled!"
        hagami "You're really looking forward to it that much?"
        mana "Of course!"
        hagami "Then..."
        "Hagami looks at me again, a wrinkle above her eyes. I think I get it. She really does want to practice, and more likely than not, we're in the way. I probably shouldn't have suggested we come down here. It was selfish of me."
        takeru "Mana, let's go."
        mana "Huh?"
        takeru "Hagami, we're looking forward to this afternoon. You'll be fine, right?"
        "Hagami narrows her eyes at me, then glances at Mana."
        takeru "See you later. But if you want to join us for lunch or something..."
        "No. Selfish. Let her practice and I can live with spending the festival without her."
        takeru "Never mind."
        mana "I can't wait to hear you perform again! It's been so long! I'm glad you're all ready!"
        hagami "Yeah..."
        "Her expression is blank but I think I know what she's thinking... Mana doesn't know the half of it."
        takeru "Bye."
        "I try to escort Mana out as fast as I can, before either girl really realizes my faux pax. What was I thinking? Interrupting Hagami? I knew she wouldn't want to be in the chaos of the festival, and Mana shouldn't see Hagami when she's in that sort of vulnerable state..."
        mana "We're going to grab lunch next?"
        takeru "Yeah."
        "Maybe my digust at myself shows in my face, because not halfway there, Mana faces me."
        mana "You're okay, Takeru?"
        takeru "What? I'm fine, yeah."
        mana "Hm."
        
        "We work our way around to the back of the school, past some of the less populated tables, and twoards the side of the gym."
        "The festival is in full swing by now. I regonize the grill I hauled up the hill two weeks ago, now at home with two student council members cooking food. All along the back wall of the school, posters advertise clubs, performances, and tables inside the gym."
        "It's still early, so Mana and I are able to find something to eat without having to wade through too many lines."
        "Plates in hand, we find an emtpy plastic table on the periphery of the festival crowds."
        mana "Today's looking great! We finally ditched your weirdo friends, and before too long, Hagami's gonna perform for the first time in forever, and..."
        mana "Takeru?"
        "I must really be zoned out if even Mana realizes something's up. I might as well just tell her or like Natsumi said, I'll just be a wet towel today."
        takeru "Guess we probably shouldn't have interrupted her practicing."
        mana "Hagami? What? Really?"
        takeru "Yeah. I guess she'll be - "
        mana "You're kidding! I think she was thrilled!"
        takeru "What?"
        mana "You were thinking about her! You showed up just because you were concerned."
        takeru "Really? I thought I was getting better at reading Hagami, but I didn't get that feeling at all..."
        mana "You just haven't known her as long is all! She only lets you in on what she wants you to know, so I wouldn't expect you'd notice."
        takeru "Wait, then..."
        "I thought Hagami was just trying to hide her uncomfortability from Mana, but that's just something she wanted me to think? No one's that deceptive, right?"
        mana "Hagami thinks she can hide stuff from me, but I've known her too long. Even when she came back from music school I still had her number."
        takeru "Music school? That Showa College place?"
        mana "Yeah. Wait, how do you know the name of it? Did she tell you that? No way! That means - "
        takeru "No, I sort of just, er, saw some old papers..."
        "But, she did show them to me, right? Hagami wanted me to figure that out?"
        mana "Anyway, she's super talented! And that's why I can't wait to hear her perform! She hasn't played anything in so long..."
        takeru "Why not?"
        "The enthusiasm drains out of Mana's face."
        takeru "Er, I get it... Social anxiety and all that, right..."
        "Mana's expression doesn't change, though."
        mana "It's kind of a long story and um, I think she should be the one to tell you about it."
        takeru "Sounds like it's not really something she wants other people to know about."
        mana "I'm sure she wants you to know! She just has to do it in her own way. It'll happen! I just know it!"
        takeru "Right..."
        takeru "You think she'll pull it off?"
        mana "Huh? Like, perform tongight?"
        takeru "Yeah."
        mana "Of course! That's a really weird question."
        "Is it? Hagami told me she wasn't feeling confident, and Mana doesn't seem to know anything about it. One of us has to have the wrong idea. Mana's known her for years so..."
        "Hagami's wasn't lying to me, right?"
        mana "Hey! Look!"
        takeru "What?"
        "Mana starts waving and shouting and I'm snapped out of my reverie."
        takeru "Who is that?"
        mana "It's Hagami! Hey! Hey Hagami, over here!"
        "Surely enough, there is someone out there by the corner of Mirako, headed this way. Mana must have some kind of Hagami-tuned radar because I sure as hell can't make out anything at this distance."
        "Finally, Mana can't contain herself and charges the distance to that far-off figure, and practically drags her to the table. Hello, Hagami."
        "When the two finally show back up, Hagami clutching a plate of food, I'm struck by how out of place she seems. Have I ever seen her anywhere outside the old wing? Hagami keeps glancing around, and every time Mana addresses her, her shoulders twinge."
        "They sit."
        hagami "Hi."
        takeru "Hey, Hagami. Good to see you."
        mana "Yeah! You made it out! Are you all done practicing for the day? I can't wait! There are so many cool booths this year, and the swim team raffle is going on, and you haven't seen..."
        "I mostly eat in silence. Hagami, too, seems distant, but she nods as Mana goes on about just about every display set up at the festival."
        "Still, though, it seems she's at least settled in."
        mana "...and Takeru knows all these horrible people! I wouldn't be surprised if he's a delinquent himself."
        takeru "Oh please."
        hagami "Hm... That's true."
        mana "And even though I offered to give him all of my cake, Takeru's roommate, this guy..."
        mana "Totally unbelievable! Remember this guy? He was you lab partner! Irreedemable, unconscionable, terrible little..."
        "While both of them are distracted, I catch sight of another pair of figures heading towards our isolated table."
        takeru "Heads up. We've got visitors."
        mana "Oh? Takeru, it's those guys!"
        takeru "I know..."
        "It could only be Kenta and Natsumi. No one else has Kenta's massive build, and no one would tolerate Kenta enough to walk beside him like that. I guess our five minutes of tranquility are over."
        natsumi "Well, well... If it isn't Takeru and friends."
        takeru "I see you found lunch."
        natsumi "I waited twenty minutes in line for this. It better be worth it."
        kenta "Technically, the laws of supply and demand dictate that if everyone else is willing to stand in line, the product is intrinsically worth - "
        mana "Can it, you!"
        mana "Why are you here talking about the trinsic value of lunch when - "
        kenta "Intrinsic. It means that the food is worth - "
        mana "I don't care! It means you're here, doesn't it? Even if I have to throw two hundred yakitori at your smugly handsome face I'll never let you near Hagami! You hear that? You'll regret being a terrible lab partner now, won't you? This one's got your name on it!"
        "I'm trying to decide whether I should prevent Mana from hurling her lunch at Kenta or just enjoy watching it play out, when Hagami jumps in instead."
        mana "Hagami?"
        "...except, her aim slips, and a piece of chicken bounces off my forehead with a thwop."
        mana "Sorry sorry sorry! I wasn't gonna actually throw it!"
        mana "Hagami, why'd you do that?"
        hagami "Well..."
        hagami "If in a few hours I have to play in front of all those people... Eating in front of them is a little easier than that."
        "Hagami recovers the dropped yakitori from the floor and drops it on the table, where Kenta scoops it up."
        kenta "Still looks edible."
        mana "You have terrible choice in food!"

        natsumi "Oh, so your the girl whose performance Takeru's dragging me to. I feel like we've met. Maybe?"
        hagami "...Maybe."
        hagami "..."
        mana "This is - "
        "Hagami cuts her off."
        hagami "My name is Hagami."
        mana "And you have to already know about Natsumi!"
        hagami "...No."
        mana "No? No way! She's the baseball team captain, even thoughs she's not even a senior, and - "
        "Hagami nods as Mana reads off Natsumi's resume, while Kenta and Natsumi and I look on."
        natsumi "That's an interesting one."
        kenta "She's a nuissance."
        takeru "You're both watching the recital. No excuses."
        kenta "Understood."
        natsumi "Mean."
        meiko "Hello, everyone."
        takeru "Meiko? Hey."
        natsumi "Hey, you made it. Where've you been all day? I seem to remember we had a promise."
        meiko "I'm sorry for the inconvenience. I've been busy with the council, trying to performances running on time, and then the fireworks, of course..."
        natsumi "Back up two seconds. Did you just say..."
        meiko "...My mistake."
        natsumi "Called it!"
        natsumi "Hey, did you all hear that?"
        mana "Huh?"
        natsumi "Fireworks! Tonight! They're on! Hey, let me see that."
        kenta "That's my program, I've added notes about timing, so get your - "
        natsumi "Right... Here! 'Speeches from the Student Council!' That's a fake, isn't it? No one would show up to a festival finale that boring."
        natsmu "...No offense."
        meiko "None taken. I see you already had this figured it out."
        natsumi "Takeru and I will let you off the hook then if you were busy with the fireworks. But if you try to escape now, I'm setting Kenta on you."
        kenta "What?"
        mana "He's terrifying! You'd better listen!"
        kenta "You are all very confusing."
        kenta "But... Meiko, if you're here, and she's here... Who's watching my booth?"
        natsumi "Oh, it should be fine. The whole point of a silent auction is you don't have to have someone watching it constantly."
        kenta "I disagree. The furniture should be guarded."
        mana "Kenta, sit down! Natsumi's right!"
        kenta "Your judgment has been very spotty so far, so I think I'd better not."
        mana "Get back here and finish your lunch! You only just sat down!"
        mana "Hagami, be right back!"
        "Kenta walks off, and Mana has to run to keep up with his huge stride. Hagami looks absolutely bewildered."
        natsumi "Heh."
        takeru "She's going kill him. And Kenta's blood will be on your hands."
        hagami "What did..."
        "But when Meiko and Natsumi look her way, Hagami shuts up."
        hagami "She..."
        meiko "Have we met? I'm Meiko."
        hagami "...Hagami."
        meiko "Oh, nice to meet you. I believe I filed the paperwork for your performance this afternoon."
        meiko "Good luck up there."
        "Hagami nods in response to each. I try to smile at her as sort of a \"sorry about my overbearing friends\" but that's not something easy to communicate without words. At least she smiles back."
        natsumi "Alright, I'm done. Meiko, have you been through the gym yet?"
        meiko "No, not since yesterday."
        natsumi "Then I've got to give you the tour. Hey Hagami how about you?"
        hagami "No, but... Hm."
        natsumi "Cool, it's settled. Come on with us, we've got to hunt down Mana and Kenta too."
        takeru "Er, maybe for Hagami we could - "
        hagami "It's fine."
        takeru "Right."
        natsumi "Then let's do it."
        
        "Nastumi leads the way back to the gym, talking to Meiko, while Hagami and I hang behind."
        takeru "Thanks for coming. Mana said you hate stuff like this."
        hagami "It's... not my favorite."
        hagami "Performing will be harder, though, so..."
        takeru "How are you feeling?"
        "She's silent."
        natsumi "Hey, Takeru, did you guys see this one? The robotics team's got a demo set up. Over here!"
        "She waves us over, and from then on, it's all bouncing from one stand to the next. Natsumi points out all the displays to Meiko and Hagami that we saw in the morning. Hagami mostly remains mute, but Natsumi is content to do the talking."
        "We end up at the swim team's booth. No sign of Mana or her senior Yumi, but we each buy a ticket for the raffle. I glare at Kenta's disk while Natsumi brags to Hagami about her brilliant auctioneering solutions to this morning's problem."
        "Next, the food science club is selling home-made ice cream. I'm still stuffed from lunch, but that doesn't seem to stop Natsumi and Meiko."
        "Finally, we come to Kenta's table. Strangely enough, there's nobody there but an elderly couple examining a chair."
        hagami "Mana..."
        takeru "They're not here?"
        natsumi "Hey, like I said, it's not like it needs a guard. Who knows what they're getting up to?"
        "Natsumi smirks, causing Hagami to raise an eyebrow."
        meiko "This all looks very professional, Natsumi."
        takeru "No way... That sign reeks of dubious. Custom-made furniture? I think he has to order these things in flatpacks or something. Kenta couldn't have made all this in a week, right?"
        meiko "Kenta can surprise you, Takeru."
        takeru "Oh trust me, he surprises me on a daily basis. Usually right in the morning."
        "I rub my forehead."
        meiko "Who we live with can be both a blessing and a curse."
        takeru "Definitely a curse."
        hagami "Terrible..."
        meiko "Hagami, you know him?"
        hagami "No, not..."
        takeru "They were lab partners."
        natsumi "Oh boy, I'm sure that was exciting."
        takeru "He's not so bad as a roommate, but as a lab partner... Yeah, I'm sorry."
        "Natsumi smiles, almost. Probably uncomfortable."
        takeru "So how are sales? Er, bids?"
        natsumi "Good question! Give me one second to check."
        "Natsumi crossed the distance to the auction tables starts lifting and shaking the shoeboxes one by one. I'm surprised when Hagami joins her, fiddling with the boxes and paper."
        takeru "That's a bad sign..."
        meiko "What? That Meiko's so into this auction? Humor her a little."
        takeru "No, that Hagami's interested."
        meiko "Oh?"
        takeru "Her sense of humor is terrible."
        meiko "Ah. How long have you known her?"
        takeru "Not too long. Er... As long as I've been at Mirako, actually. She's put up with a lot from me."
        meiko "Hm, then keep looking out for her."
        takeru "What?"
        "But Meiko just smiles. Before I can ask what she means, she turns away."
        meiko "Pardon, but I need to go check on a few items. I might be a bit, so let Natsumi know."
        takeru "Hang on, you're going where?"
        meiko "Be back later."
        takeru "What..."
        "I watch her slip behind a passing family and into the crowd."
        natsumi "I'm back. Good news is there looks like some good volume on the bids, but - "
        natsumi "Hey, Takeru, where's Meiko?"
        takeru "She said she had somewhere else to be and she just sort of... left."
        natsumi "Slacker! You let her escape? I thought you were more responsible than this."
        takeru "How's that my job?"
        hagami "Over there."
        "Hagami bails me out. She's pointing towards the back door, where Meiko is holding it open for a few students. She then disappears outside."
        natsumi "Aha! I'll take point. Takeru, cover me."
        takeru "From what? Student council spies?"
        natsumi "That's ridiculous, quit joking around and help me chase her down."
        hagami "Bye."
        takeru "Wait, Hagami, are you - "
        hagami "I'll guard the booth."
        "Natsumi hauls me off before I can say anything, while Hagami just raises an eyebrow. Thanks for not helping, Hagami."
        
        "Once we're outside, it's not hard to track down Meiko. There are hardly any people out on this side of the building, just some empty tables, less popular displays, and... that shrine Kenta I saw yesterday."
        "Meiko's standing there now, in front of the open shrine doors. This is about the point where I'd turn around, but of course Natsumi walks up and taps her on the shoulder."
        natsumi "Thought you could escape so easily, eh?"
        meiko "Natsumi?"
        natsumi "Takeru would let you get away but I'm a bit harder."
        natsumi "...Did you have to get back to the student council or something?"
        meiko "Haha, oh, nothing like that."
        "Meiko laughs when Natsumi suddenly looks flustered."
        meiko "I just needed to drop off the book. I realize I forgot it this morning. I did say I would only be gone a second, didn't I?"
        natsumi "Takeru, you could've said that when we were still inside. Sorry, Meiko. My informant here left out the crucial details."
    
    "Meiko smiles at Natsumi's comment, but she still glances at me."
    natsumi "What's the shrine?"
    meiko "It's not much, but..."
    "Meiko turns the table around to face the path. There's still no photo on Hikari's shrine, but now the pieces to her chess set are arranged on a wooden board. The knight is still missing."
    "While we watch, Meiko lights two candles, then opens a thin, hardcover book on the table. The cover is a mellow blue, and the pages completely empty."
    meiko "You remember Hikari?"
    natsumi "Well..."
    "For the first time today, Natsumi looks something less than cheerful."
    natsumi "I'll leave my respects."
    "She picks up the pen and scratches some words onto the page. I guess the idea is students are supposed to record their memories of Hikari. It seems a little off the beaten path for something like that."
    "When Natsumi straigtens up, I walk up to the shrine to write my own message, but Meiko gives me an odd look."
    "Right. I haven't met Hikari. At least as far as Meiko knows."
    "...I wonder if Hikari even remembers Meiko?"
    natsumi "Okay. Meiko, you're ready to go now?"
    meiko "I need to duck out before the finale tonight, remember though."
    natsumi "But that means you're free now. Come on!"
    meiko "Alright. Let's go."
    natsumi "I thought it'd be Takeru that'd be uncooperative, but turns out it's even harder to keep an eye on you."
    meiko "I keep my promises, even if I don't have my day all planned in a schedule like Kenta."
    natsumi "Good! That'd be scary."
    natsumi "Are you set to come back in, Meiko? It's really quiet out here."
    meiko "All set."
    "She heads back down the path, while Natsumi and I walk behind."
    natsumi "Today's looking up, eh Takeru? Two objectives complete. Meiko's been captured, and the firework show's a go. Shocking we're able to get so much done when you're snoozing on the job."
    takeru "Come on, it's not that shocking... Besides I already knew about the fireworks."
    natsumi "You jerk! And you didn't tell me?"
    meiko "It's a secret, Natsumi."
    natsumi "Secrets are for telling your friends, you dope."
    natsumi "Still, it's not the Mirako school festival without fireworks. We've got a school legend to keep up."
    natsumi "...So Takeru, you know who you'll be watching the fireworks with?"
    takeru "You guys, I guess."
    natsumi "Bzzt. Wrong answer. You're supposed to watch with just me."
    takeru "Oh not this again."
    meiko "If you two want to find someplace private and - "
    natsumi "A starless night, fireworks under the moon..."
    "Meiko laughs when she sees the consternation on my face."

    mana "In the first place shouldn't have - "
    natsumi "Okay, I think we get it. What was this about frogs?"
    mana "And then he told her Takeru had all sorts of dead stuff in jars in the desk! Yumi was totally grossed out, and then she gave me this look, and - "

    natsumi "It's a silent auction. No need for everyone to show up while we go through the bids. We'll just post the results and people can check it out after the fireworks."
    meiko "This is very well-planned, Natsumi."

        "Maybe I should leave this to Mana. She's known Hagami for a long time, and if we find Hagami in the library bawling her eyes out I think I'd just make things more uncomfortable for everyone. Why am I always terrible at things like this?"

    hagami "If I hadn't... That's why I hate myself. I'm here, and not there."
    takeru "Hey, don't be so hard on yourself, I mean..."
    hagami "You can still leave. Go watch the fireworks."
    takeru "I'll stay here. I want to listen."
    hagami "I... don't want to talk, but..."
    hagami "I didn't feel this way until I met you."
    hagami "When it was just Mana and I me, it was... comfortable? I guess? She's been too good to me, and she understands, and..."
    hagami "She knew me before I went to that Showa school, when I was just a middle schooler who was good at the piano."
    hagami "You... have never heard me play."
    takeru "Right."
    hagami "So..."
    hagami "It's funny. Before you came along I never felt like I had to prove myself. I thought... 'What if I could talk to him properly? As a normal person, instead of some coward who hides behind books in the library all day?'"
    hagami "And then... I sort of managed it. I think."
    takeru "Er, you did. I've never thought of you like that."
    hagami "I'm saying, that's how I saw myself. Just..."
    hagami "Then I thought, if I could do that... I need to prove myself. You've never heard me play anything, and I thought, if I could get used to you, then, that wouldn't be so hard..."
    hagami "Mana thinks I'm some sort of genius. I'm not. If I can't even perform in front of anyone, I'm worse than the newest beginner. I hate that. I know I'm better than that, so why..."
    hagami "Before you showed up, I was content. And now I want to prove myself. That's it."
    hagami "...I told you it was a stupid breakthrough."
    takeru "I... Er..."
    takeru "Then you're not mad I pushed through the performance application?"
    hagami "Thank you. I never would've done it."
    hagami "Mana is fine with me as me. I don't want to be me, I want to be someone better. I want..."
    "Hagami smiles briefly, like a silent laugh."
    hagami "I want to be that genius Mana thinks I am. Takeru, I want... You shouldn't have to guess. I want to show you that I am talented. I'm angry with myself because I couldn't do that today."
    "She looks down at the piano in front of her. Her fingers are loose on the keys."
    "For my part, I don't what I'm doing here. I feel like I should be here, beside her, that I should walk over to her and tell her that she doesn't have to prove anything, and that..."
    "I wish I could articulate myself as well as she can, right now. Now I'm the one to feel stupid, all I can offer is half a platitude."
    takeru "You don't have to be anything you don't..."
    hagami "I don't care what they diagnose me with, I want to be world-class. Takeru, do you know the Moonlight Sonata?"
    takeru "No, sorry, I don't really know too much about classical music."
    hagami "That's fine."
    hagami "I feel, after getting all that off my chest, that... This is so much easier than I thought."
    "Her back straightens. For a moment, I flash back to those tense minutes on stage, Hagami in this posture, always seemingly one second away from starting to play."
    "But this time there's less than a second to wait."
    "Hagami lowers her fingers, melds them into the keys, the most natural motion in the world. My ear for music is terrible, but even I can appreciate what I hear. The music is soft but deliberate, slow and shining. That's right. The piece is called that... \"Moonlight.\""
    "The sound is trancelike, effortless. I feel like the half the wonder of it is lost on me, with my total lack of musical talent, and I'm ashamed that I can only partially understand exactly what Hagami is creating before me."
    "Even on this antique piano, in this dusty room, she's extraordinary."
    "There's no sheet music in front of her. After all these years, does she still have this piece committed to memory?"
    "Her eyelids hang low, her breathing slows, her every moment seems free of tension, relaxed. Then on one final chord, she looks up."
    takeru "That was..."
    "She silences me with narrowed eyes. Was that only the next movement? I'm about to apologize for interrupting when she breaks into an ear-to-ear wicked grin and turns back to the keyboard."
    "If what before I was hearing was slow, painstaking, beautiful, what Hagami plays now is an all-out attack. Her fingers flash from one ends of the piano to the other in sequence after sequence of precision arpeggios."
    "When she breaks for something slower, more expressive, I note the sweat on her foreheard. Even though her devilish smile is wrakced with concentration, it never leaves her face."
    "And then she breaks into the upspeed, flurry of notes, fingers moving faster than I can follow."
    "There's an explosion. At first I think the piano snapped or else the roof caved in, but then I spot the flash out the window."
    "Fireworks. Of course. They're starting already."
    "Hagami pays them no mind. She hits another chord, eyes closed, and continues on in relentless attack."
    "Outside, beyond the window pane, the night streaks with white as there's another burst in the sky above. The roar of the distant booms seems lost amid Hagami's furious performance, but the flashes of white, orange, blue, then white again that fill the room illuminate her against the piano."
    "She breaks into another slower section. Well, not slow. More expressive. As if in response, blue crackling streamers fill the sky. Hagami must notice by now. Then I see she has, glancing out the window as a sphere of white lights flickers, explodes, and fades."
    "Hagami looks at me, and her face is almost unhuman. Her fingers quiver between two notes, smile growing the whole time until it's something demonic."
    "She ends on one resounding note."
    "The fireworks continue outside. Hagami rises, and I don't quite remember when I got off my box, but I'm standing too. She's laughing now, ecstatic."
    hagami "You see? I can do it. I knew I could do it, so..."
    takeru "That was amazing. I had no idea."
    hagami "Thank you."
    hagami "I want to be world class, Takeru. I hate that I'm weak now, but I know I can do it, I know it."
    takeru "I believe you."
    "Face to face, she grips my left hand in her right. Or is it me who did that?"
    "Beyond the window, the sky streaks white, violet, violet, then crackles in a scintillating orange. Not that I'm watching directly. It's Hagami's unflinching eyes I'm looking at. I've never seen that resolve in her, or that ecstatsy from the end of the sonata."
    "It's like I'm looking at a different person."
    "Slowly, it fades."
    "Her head lowers."
    "The fireworks trail off. Five white spheres launch up above the treeline, then a single red rocket. Is that the finale? She lets go of my hand."
    hagami "Is that..."
    hagami "You didn't leave."
    takeru "How could I?"
    hagami "Then you think... I..."
    takeru "I want to see it."
    takeru "Er... I believe you. I think you can do it, and I want to be there to watch."
    takeru "Mana was right. You're incredible."
    hagami "It's... a long way to go."
    hagami "I think I can do it, now."
    hagami "I failed tonight, but that..."
    hagami "It's nothing. I'm twice as determined."
    takeru "I don't know if it's anything, but, I'll back you up. If I can help, let me know. Everyone else should be able to hear that, what I just watched. I..."
    "I'm caught up in her eyes. That full smile she had from the last act of the sonata, that's gone, but the traces are still in her eyes. Some sort of deep fire."
    hagami "I want to count on you."
    takeru "Do it, then."
    "It's like talking to a different person. Or that I myself am somewhere else."
    hagami "I'll prove myself to you, then. And the rest of the world."
    
    "We emerge into the clear night."
    "There were a few students in the gym, tearing down booths and tables at the end of the festival, and our here, there's more traffic as people return from watching the fireworks in the field. But off to the side of the path, the night is still silent."
    takeru "Sorry. Meiko said she wanted to meet our here. Did you see the shrine today?"
    hagami "No."
    takeru "She had something set up to remember Hikari. From what I can tell, they were friends, last year."
    "I fill her in as head down the path."
    "It feels strange, walking with her like this. Back in the piano room, I saw someone different, a fearless, passionate Hagami, different than the person beside me. Knowing that next to me, she has that kind of strength..."
    "It's somewhere between intimidating and reassuring. At the very least, I appreciate her in a new light."
    "I stop when I spot a dark figure on the path ahead. They look this way, and I squint, straining the limits of my night vision."
    takeru "Meiko? Is that you?"
    meiko "Mana too."
    "Another shadow steps out from behind her."
    mana "Takeru?"
    mana "And Hagami. Hagami! You're here!"
    "There's a thumping sound of running footfalls and then a whoosh beside me as Mana tackles the stunned Hagami."
    mana "You're here! Hagami's here! I'm so proud of you! You got up on that stage, and you, you - "
    mana "You've come so far! I remember when you were about to run away when Takeru showed up on his first day, and now, now you - "
    mana "One of these days you'll have to let me hear you play again, but... You're incredible! You're the best!"
    hagami "Um, Mana..."
    "Maybe she's a little tired of Mana hanging off her shoulders. Meiko closes the distance on the path, and in the moonlight, comes into view."
    meiko "You remembered."
    takeru "Sorry. I got a bit distracted."
    meiko "That's fine. You are coming to the shrine, correct?"
    takeru "Right."
    mana "I'm coming as well. I want to remember Hikari."
    meiko "And you, you're Hagami? You knew Hikari?"
    hagami "In a way."
    meiko "It's all very strange to me. Takeru, one of these days you'll have to tell me how you knew her, but for now, take this. Mana, Hagami, you too."
    "In the dark, I can't tell what she's fiddling with in her bag, but in a moment, she passes me a sparkler. Mana and Hagmai also take one."
    meiko "These were her favorite."
    meiko "I know it's a little hard to see, so, be careful. Follow me."
    "For a moment her eyes catch in the moonlight and I see something at constrast with her level words, but I follow Meiko down the path anyway. Mana trails right behind, unlit sparkler in hand, while Hagami trails next to me."
    "Two dots of light come into view, and Meiko halts in front of them. Looks like the candles on the shrine haven't gone out yet. Meiko turns."
    meiko "These were her favorite."
    meiko "I'm not sure how any of you knew Hikari. Sometimes it feels like everyone still knows her, and sometimes it feels like everyone forgot."
    meiko "Tonight, it's been like she was here beside us. I hope she was watching the fireworks, from somewhere above. I know it's what she would've wanted. It was silly of me to try to put a hold on them on her behalf."
    meiko "Even if she isn't here beside us, I want to say a prayer. A year ago, I pledged not to forget her, and now, I want to renew that. Hikari, wherever you are..."
    meiko "I won't forget you."
    "Meiko lights her own sparkler by one of the candles. As she turns, it lights an arc through the night. Mana's sparkler lights up, then she passes the flame to Hagami, then me. We stand facing the shirne."
    "It's still anonymous. There's no photo of Hikari, and nothing to remember her but the chess set, still missing its green knight."
    "It feels strange to just hold the sparkler here, lit. When I was younger, with my parents at the Tanabata festival, I'd spin and paint glowing lines in the air in front of me. Now the crackling spark is more like a memorial candle."
    "In the on-and-off light provided by the sparklers, I see Meiko produce something from her pocket. It could be anything, at first, some dark object silhouetted by the uneven light. I only recognize when she sets it down the chess board."
    "It's the green knight, the missing green knight. The set is complete."
    "Meiko kneels."
    "If this was a spiritual moment, I can't bring myself to shut my eyes. I never was any good at ceremony. Mana seems to be staring at the ground, but Hagami also has her eyes straight ahead. Then what happens next must be visible to both of us."
    "Where before there was only darkness behind the shrine, I spot a light. I think it's another sparkler at first, or maybe two, but then her shape becomes clear. Hagami is standing there, in front of her own shrine, blinking slowly."
    takeru "Hikari..."
    "I mouth her name, and she smiles."
    "There's movement next to me. Hagami has her hand up. Is she... waving?"
    "A wave. A call to attention, or... a sendoff. A farewell to a departure."
    "Hikari returns the gesture, and I notice, around her slight frame, oddities that interact unevenly with the flickering light."
    "No, that's it, she's flickering, like a fire on the breeze. Hikari waves back. Then I too raise my hand in farewell. That must be it, tonight. Hagami was right again. Tonight is goodbye."
    hikari "Takeru, Hagami..."
    hikari "Maybe I'll see you again, after a long time."
    hikari "Don't disappoint me, and... take care."
    takeru "Goodbye."
    hagami "Goodbye, Hikari."
    "Her wave fades and murmurs, and she disappears into black."
    "In that moment, Meiko rises."
    meiko "It seems..."
    meiko "I know she's watching us. Takeru, you said as much earlier, but I know she was here today. Whether down here with us, or somewhere up there..."
    meiko "I'll remember you, Hikari."
    hagami "I couldn't forget."
    takeru "I won't either."
    mana "Hikari! Goodbye, Hikari! I'll miss you! Come back soon!"
    "And we stand, staring at the sky."
    "Something up there flickers. A new star? A sparkler, to match our extinguished ones here on earth?"
    "It doesn't seem to matter. Meiko has her eyes closed, but she speaks level."
    meiko "We should head back."
    takeru "Yeah."
    meiko "Natsumi's probably wondering what happened to everyone."
    takeru "And Kenta."
    mana "We're probably half an hour behind when he wanted to get home!"
    takeru "More like an hour. He'll be livid."
    hagami "And you had furniture."
    takeru "What?"
    hagami "You had furniture to move."
    takeru "Oh great, don't remind me. I'm not doing that tonight, no way. It's late as is."
    meiko "You did have a deal with Natsumi. She won't be - "
    takeru "Screw Natsumi. With all that screwiness with the auction she can't seriously expect me to..."
    "We walk back down the path, chatting and joking about the festival, tomorrow, and the days after that."
    "When I glance over my shoulder, though, the moon shines bright, surrounded by stars, one especially bright."
    "There's someone else looking back, too. Hagami."
    "World-class. I know she has it in her. That's what Hikari said as well. I glance at Hagami, and she smiles back. Walking along that path at night, my purpose seems magnified and like never before I know what I want to do. I'll stand beside her. She's world-class."

label d15_hikari:

    "As we pass the shrine that Meiko set up, Hikari falls back to walk beside me."
    hikari "Takeru."
    takeru "Hikari... Hey."
    takeru "Have you been tailing me all day?"
    hikari "What else was I supposed to do? It looks like you had a decent day anyway."
    takeru "You know you didn't have to hide. You could've just actually wandered around with us like a normal person."
    hikari "It would've made you uncomfortable."
    takeru "No, er, I mean - "
    hikari "It doesn't matter."
    hikari "Takeru, honestly though..."
    "I gulp. I knew this question was coming but now I -"
    hikari "What is that?"
    takeru "Wait what?"
    hikari "On that table. Who stole my chess set? And the board, to boot."
    takeru "Oh. That's Meiko's doing. You know that's your shrine, right? Meiko spent all of yesterday setting it up. It probably seems a little weird, but - "
    "For a moment there's a panic in Hikari's eyes that I don't understand."
    hikari "Very thoughtful of her..."
    takeru "Er..."
    takeru "You are looking forward to the fireworks, right?"
    hikari "Of course."
    takeru "Meiko will be there. I know you say everyone's forgottn you, but she obviously hasn't. What do you think she'll - "
    hikari "I don't want to think about it. There's more on my mind."
    takeru "Right."
    "Probably it's the chance of imminent disappearance that's weighing her down. She has to know."
    natsumi "Hey! Takeru, Mana, over here! And hey, is that Hagami? Welcome back."
    mana "Natsumi! Hello!"
    natsumi "Took you long enough."
    kenta "The fireworks are about to start. You're very lucky, Takeru. Next time try to be more timely."
    takeru "Where's Meiko?"
    "Natsumi points to the stage as we all take our seats on the blanket."
    "Meiko is up at the microphone, that student council guy with the glasses trying to plug it in. It's truly night, now. The stage spotlights illuminate the platform, but the rest of the field is shadowed. It's a good thing I remembered where we were sitting."
    natsumi "The principal already spoke, so this is it. Then... Boom."
    "She pantomimes an explosion with her hands."
    natsumi "Takeru, Mana, you're new to the Mirako festival fireworks, so hold on to your seats. Aside from the baseball team, it's the best thing about this school. Get ready!"
    "Natsumi turns around when Meiko taps on the mic, and the sound reverberates around the field."
    meiko "Hello?"
    meiko "Ah. Thank you all for coming out to Mirako today. My name is Kotaru Meiko, member of the student council and head of the student festival organizing committee."
    meiko "To our visitors, we're glad to have you and hope you enjoyed what our school has to offer. To our students, thank you for working so hard to put this on."
    "Good old Meiko, addressing hundreds of people as this were just another day in homeroom."
    meiko "I hope you've all enjoyed today as much as I've enjoyed working with you all to set it up."
    meiko "To wrap up the festivities we'd originally planned to say a few words this year instead of our usual Mirako tradition. That's what's printed on your programs now. To that effect I'd - "
    "Something catches in her throat and for a moment I swear she's looking our way. Hikari beside me gives a little jump."
    meiko "I'd like to say..."
    meiko "That's much less interesting than fireworks."
    meiko "Here's to a wonderful year so far and many more to come. Enjoy the show."
    "Short and to the point. The crowd applauds, but I notice Meiko steps off the stage on the far side, rather than walking towards us."
    "I'm soon distracted, however, by a bursting noise back in the treeline, and then overhead... The fireworks."
    "An upbeat orchestral song starts playing over the speaker system, but it's nothing to compete with the echoing blasts in the sky."
    "At first, the designs are simple. Concentric circles, showers of stars... The fizzing orange streamers that shoot off in all directions with a satisfying crackle. Then in time with drums on the background track, four stars go off, first in yellow, then white, then violet and blue."
    "It's impressive. Not so much because of the quality of the fireworks, but because of the intimacy. I can remember seeing a much bigger show at a Tanabata festival in Sendai, but that was for tens of thousands of people. This show is for Mirako only."
    "Four more star-shaped bursts go up, all white this time, then another row of all yellow. With each boom, the mountains beyond Mirako are illuminated by the explosion in the sky. The echo isn't only from the school behind us, but from the whole valley."
    "Another firework goes off, this one in the shape of a diamond latticed with lingering bursts of red and white."
    mana "Wow..."
    natsumi "I told you."
    "I have to admit. It's breathtaking."
    takeru "I can't believe they were going to cancel this..."
    takeru "Hikari, what do you - "
    "I turn, but..."
    takeru "Hikari?"
    kenta "Takeru, quiet down."
    takeru "Where'd she... Kenta, did you see..."
    takeru "Never mind."
    kenta "Where are you going?"
    takeru "Be right back."

    "I wish I knew where I was going. The light from the fireworks occasionally lights my path, but the darkness is thick only a small ways from the stage."
    "And more importantly, I don't where to go. I just need to find Hikari. There's no way she just went up in smoke like that, without a single word, ten seconds into something she'd looked forward to for a year."
    takeru "Please let her have just run off again, please..."
    "I'm jogging back towards Mirako, not really because I think Hikari might have gone this way, but more out of reflex."
    "WHUNK."
    "I swear my head makes a hollow sounds as I smack into a tree. Getting back up, I try to navigate by the flashes of light from the sky above, to some success. At least I manage to find the trail."
    "Should I shout for her? Calling Hikari's name out here is probably just going to attract the wrong kind of attention. Will she even be listening?"
    "...Is she even out here?"
    "The background track fades out this far from the field, and all I can hear now is the resounding boom that comes with each flash in the sky. It's the only light. Then... I see two red pinpricks in the distance."
    "I jump back at first, but of course, it's not some rabid red-eyed animal. Those are lights, candles in fact... From the shrine."
    "Careful to avoid tripping over and loose dirt or roots, I draw closer. One of the candles disappears for a moment, and I realize it's because someone or something moved in front of it."
    "It has to be her. Hikari's there. She has to still be here."
    "Only a few yards away now, I can see an outline by the candlight. With another boom, the sky is lit white and I can see her standing in front of me."
    takeru "Hikari! It really is you."
    hikari "You chased me all the way out here? Can't you take a hint?"
    takeru "If you didn't want me wandering all over looking for you, you shouldn't have stuck around for the performance in the piano room."
    hikari "I couldn't help it. Sorry. I got too attached so - "
    "She's interrupted when the sky turns white and there's more thundering in the sky above. I take the moment to close the distance to the shrine, and thankfully, she doesn't run away. Instead, she has her hands on the blue-bound book with the visitors' messages."
    takeru "What are you doing out here?"
    hikari "I know what's going to happen, Takeru. I overheard all of it, with you and Hagami."
    takeru "I'm a coward. Saying to your face that you... That tonight you'd probably... Why'd it have to be you?"
    takeru "I'm sorry."
    hikari "That's alright. When I said I wanted you to be honest with me, I really did mean it back then."
    takeru "You're braver than me."
    hikari "I thought I could handle it, but then, I saw Meiko, and..."
    hikari "Takeru, she was my best friend. No doubt about it. And tonight I couldn't even remember where I knew her. I forget her completely, Takeru, it's all starting to slip away, and I'm terrified..."
    "Hikari opens the book. Inside are a few messages from people that knew her, but Hikari flips to the very first page. By the candlelight, all I can see is a smudge of writing and the shape of Hikari's face above it. Then a flash illuminates the page."
    "It's filled, top to bottom, two pages, in neat, tight handwriting that I know could only belong to Meiko."
    hikari "We started here at Mirako together. We were alone, we trusted each other, and... She says I pulled her out of misery and loneliness and she wouldn't be here if I..."
    hikari "I can't remember any of that and I'm afraid."
    hikari "Last night I said I was fine even I just spent one last night with all of you, something to remember before I left. I'm too frightened to even do that, because, I know if..."
    hikari "I'm going to forget you."
    hikari "And Hagami, and Mana, and all of you that I met this year. Takeru, really, all I wanted to do was watch the fireworks with you. I was robbed of my chance for a happy ending in life, but I didn't think that was too much to ask. Guess not."
    takeru "It's not too late."
    hikari "It is. Hikari was right. I can feel it all slipping away now."
    takeru "Not that. It's not too late to watch the fireworks... Just look up."
    "As I speak, the sky is filled with crackling blue stars, then white streams of fire."
    hikari "Ha. You're missing the point completely, Takeru, and I have no idea why I'm all worked up I won't remember you."
    hikari "I'll take your advice though."
    "The sky turns white and I can see her face next to mine, eyes skyward. As she watches the afterimages of the sparks above the trees, her expression turns from a frown into something introspective, neutral, as if gazing a hundred miles into the distance."
    hikari "Then take my hand, Takeru."
    takeru "What?"
    "Back in the tearoom, when she admitted to being a ghost, she tried this as proof. My hand just slipped right through."
    "She's making fun of me."
    hikari "Just look up, watch the fireworks, and do it."
    "I look upwards. A shower of purple streams shoots up, then three white stars one after the other. Like an idiot, I stick my arm out and open my hand."
    takeru "Hikari..."
    hikari "Just watch."
    "To my amazement, I can feel something. Human warmth. Her fingers around mine. It could only be Hikari, next to me, staring up into the illuminated night sky."
    "I feel each second tick past but it could never be long enough. With us both silent, the muffled music from the stage in the distance is audible, broken by the periodic bursting roar of fireworks and crackle of explosions in the sky."
    "There are more streamers, then balls of white orange. With each firework, the hills and mountains around Mirako also jump into contrast with the black of the dark beyond."
    "I want to turn to face her. But Hikari is transfixed, and I don't dare look straight at her."
    takeru "I can see why you were looking forward to this."
    hikari "It really is a beautiful world."
    "Sparkling blues, then four showers of sparks, lingering white dots suspended for ages like stars..."
    "It must be the finally. The background track from the stage speakers is drawing to a close, and the sky is lit violet, red, violet, orange, cascading one after the other."
    "Finally, the music stops. One last boom echoes around the valley and a sphere of white hangs in the air."
    "It really is amazing. But if I admit to myself, it's really her by my side that holds my attention. Her presence, her warmth..."
    "Warmth?"
    "The only warmth... is my own fingers against my hand."
    "Just like that day in the tearoom, I'm left holding nothing."
    "When I turn, of course... There is no Hikari."
    "The blue book is closed. The candles wave in the still air, a glow just bright enough to see the shrine and the orange and green chess set, still missing a lone knight."
    "Missing."
    "The hair on my arms raises, a response to something beyond my comprehension."
    "I'm not sure if I fall over or sit, but I'm cross-legged on the ground now. The sound of the last firework keeps bounding around my skull, then settles lower, somewhere in my chest. Then it just subsides into my heartbeat."
    "I know it, I just know it, that this time she hasn't just disappeared so she can listen or vanished just to screw with me. I look at my open palm. There's a finality written there, so clear to me that all I can do is screw up my eyes and sit here on this path."
    "Hikari, I pray your last memory was a happy one. And I don't care if you forget me, but I'll always remember you."
    
    natsumi "On the count of three. One, two..."
    natsumi "Come on, Takeru, at least pretend to be paying attention. We'll be here all night at this rate."
    "We're two of maybe twenty students milling around the gym, collapsing tables and taking down signs. When the festival started, I thought this place looked cheery with all the flags and posters in here, but now, half-disassembled, the place looks depressing."
    takeru "Sorry. I got distracted again."
    natsumi "No kidding. I think you're intentionally trying to break my back. Still mad at me for winning all this furniture, eh?"
    takeru "No, that's fine..."
    natsumi "Kenta and Mana will be wondering what happened to us. Unless they already managed to drop my shiny new desk and are rolling down the hill with it right now."
    takeru "Maybe."
    "NATSUMI drops her half of the table with a dull sound that probably disturbed some of Kenta's beloved dovetail joints."
    natsumi "Okay, Takeru. First you run off during the fireworks and now you won't even laugh at my jokes. And I'm pretty damn funny, when I'm trying."
    natsumi "So what's eating you?"
    takeru "Not much."
    natsumi "Now you're trying to be funny. Seriously, what's up?"
    takeru "Do you remember the girl you met today with all the carvings displayed? Hikari?"
    natsumi "No. I do remember you promising to head to the hobby shop tomorrow to buy Kenta that carving knife though. You can't be dreading an afternoon with Kenta that much."
    takeru "I didn't think you'd remember..."
    natsumi "Are you feeling alright? You're supposed to feel all optimistic and inspired after the Mirako fireworks, not mopey and slow."
    natsumi "Did you try to confess and get rejected or something? I guess Meiko's playing hard to get. Or maybe it was - "
    takeru "Oh stop kidding around."
    natsumi "Man. Then it really is something serious."
    natsumi "Here's the deal, Takeru. You're excused from moving my new desk, my new table, and my new set of chairs... For now. Come on back tomorrow and let's get this done. You can tell Mana and Kenta we're done for the night too."
    natsumi "I don't know what your problem is but uh... You're kind of getting me down. Listen I know I've been a bit of a jerk to you once in a while but if I can help, let me know what's up."
    takeru "Right."
    natsumi "You're hard to crack for a guy with heartbreak written all over his face. Okay, good night, Takeru. Bring gloves tomorrow, and a maybe a back brace. We got furniture to move."
    takeru "See you tomorrow."
    "Natsumi waves goodbye, flashes a sheepish grin, then heads for the door. I'm left to sit on the desk and try to put anything together."
    "After I managed to pull myself away from Hikari's shrine I was a bit of a wreck, but I managed to get myself back here at least."
    "Hagami and Mana showed up, and I guess Hagami went home. Somehow Natsumi recruited Mana to haul back her winnings, but they're probably home at the dorms by now."
    "Most of the students left in the gym now are packing up valuables, or else student council members tasked with taking down the decorations set up by the school. It's distinctly unfestive and watching the festival crumble away is just depressing."
    "I can't really say I'm depressed myself. More confused. It feels like something hot keeps stinging me from back behind my stomach, but I can keep that down. My mind is racing and I just can't be bothered to deal with Natsumi."
    "Students keep filtering out out of the gym. We don't have to have everything cleaned up until tomorrow, so it looks like most people are just heading home for the night."
    "I wonder how many of them remember Hikari as a student. And how many remember her now, as a ghost? A ghost, or... something else? Just someone in my mind?"
    "My hand clenches and unclenches. I definitely felt her. She was real, and I can't forget. It was a stupid, meaningless promise and sitting here under the fluorescent lights the more I just feel like an idiot for letting her slip away."
    "It felt as real and meaningful as anything, and now an hour later, I'm sitting here on a tacky desk watching people take down tacky decorations. It's all useless. That's what I think."
    "Suddenly sitting around seems offensive. Doing nothing feels irreverent when I've just witnessed... Something. Enough of a something that it's idiotic for me to sit here pretending nothing important happened. I'm about to scream."
    "Natsumi doesn't remember anything. Kenta and Mana are too oblivious to notice anything wrong. Hagami ran home almost as soon as the fireworks ended. Even if I wanted to explain this whole thing to someone, there's no one left that I can -"
    "Meiko?"
    "I haven't seen her... I assumed she was still out at the field, working to take down the stage, but..."
    "I wonder."
    
    "Exiting the gym, I'm struck by a chill in the night air. I was here only an hour or two ago and everything felt so alive, but now the path is empty, the booths are gone."
    "All but one. To my surprise, there are still two shadows flickering in the distance."
    "For a moment it feels like someone punched me in the gut. I don't want to go back there, but there's no place left to go."
    "Then I hear it. Or, I hear something. Voices? No, a single voice, saying... Saying nothing. Just a wordless, wracking breathing, somewhere between a sobbing and panting. It's an ugly noise. When I approach, it muffles and stifles. There's someone at the shrine."
    takeru "Hikari?"
    "...but only for a second do I mistake that person for her. It's only Meiko standing there, gritting her teeth in the candlight."
    meiko "Who... Takeru?"
    takeru "Sorry. I thought - "
    meiko "What on earth are you doing here?"
    takeru "I... I just wondered where you were."
    "It's the easiest lie I can come up with. Meiko doesn't look in any state to listen to my ravings about her former best friend who may or may not have just vanished before my eyes."
    meiko "Why did you sign it?"
    takeru "What?"
    meiko "I put out the book for everyone to leave their memories of their time with Hikari, and... Why did you sign? You couldn't have known her. It's not possible, and I don't think..."
    meiko "But you knew her name. You knew she would've loved to be here to see the fireworks..."
    takeru "I'm sure she was an amazing person."
    meiko "That's not the half of it. I owe her so much, and then..."
    meiko "I was supposed to give her eulogy today. When we scheduled in our speeches, where the fireworks happened, that's what I wanted to do. Even when we brought back the fireworks... I was supposed to give a speech for her."
    takeru "You mean where you were up there on stage today?"
    meiko "That's right. Why am I even explaining this to you..."
    meiko "Aside from you and me, less than ten people put there names down in this book. Why does no one care? Is it really so painful to remember Hikari that everyone just sort of drifts on?"
    meiko "I wanted to speak up today, and really remember her as she was, and... I couldn't do it. No one wants to hear about her. They want to hear about fireworks, not some student that passed on without us."
    meiko "Why did you convince me to bring back the fireworks in the first place..."
    takeru "You know she would've loved to have seen them."
    meiko "I do."
    takeru "She was watching, from somewhere."
    meiko "You're awfully sure of yourself."
    takeru "Do you think she wanted to hear you talk about her, or do you think she wanted to enjoy the festival and everything that came with it?"
    meiko "I wonder."
    "Meiko pulls something out of her pocket. It takes a minute for me to identify it in the poor light, but I see it's a carved and painted piece of wood, cylindrical in shape. That's... It's the missing knight, right?"
    "She places it on the chessboard, forming a complete set."
    takeru "You had that this whole time?"
    meiko "I had to hold on to something. When you lose someone like that..."
    meiko "I don't know. I felt like I needed something physical that I could hold in my hand, right here, and know she was here. Even if everyone else forgets, just that one little green knight proves she was here."
    meiko "She carved this set herself, you know."
    takeru "Right."
    meiko "Maybe it's time I let go."
    meiko "I apologize, you're about the last person I expected out here so I don't know why it's you I'm telling this to... I guess no one else in our class really notices her absence that much."
    meiko "Take this."
    takeru "What is it?"
    meiko "A sparkler."
    "I notice she has a dozen more in her left hand that she quickly stows in a bag by her side. Was she expecting more people out here at this time of night?"
    meiko "These really were her favorite. I hope you're right that she could see the fireworks tonight, from wherever she is."
    "She strikes a match, and then with her burning sparkler, lights the one in my hand as well. The sparks burn a bright yellow-white, blinding me to everything but the two points of light in the air."
    meiko "Beautiful, aren't they?"
    takeru "For sure. If she can see right now..."
    meiko "You know, sparklers and fireworks and all that... They're not just supposed to be pretty."
    takeru "Yeah?"
    meiko "They symbolize transience. Everyone and everything just passed wistfully, with enough time. There's always an ending."
    takeru "Except sometimes it's too soon."
    meiko "It's always too soon. I wish I could've introduced you two... That she's not standing here, right now, can only be... I don't know, some random act of divine cruelty."
    "Meiko drops her sparkler. Before I can shout, she stamps on it, extinguishing the sparks shooting from the tip."
    takeru "What - "
    meiko "Always too soon..."
    meiko "Takeru, I really appreciate that you came out tongiht and signed the book and all, but this really is something I think I have to deal with on my own. Good night."
    "Just like that, she's gone. There are a few scuffles as she trudges down the path, but Meiko is gone. I'm left holding my half burned sparkler, wondering what she meant."
    "It's funny. When I was a kid, I would be swinging this thing around, drawing patterns in the afterimage. Now all I can do is stare at the white point as the sparks burn into my vision."
    "Another half minute passes before the sparkler completely burns out. All that remains is the metal rod gripped in my shaking hand. The illusory whiteness is still on my retinas and I've completely lost my nightvision."
    "When my eyes adjust, I notice one of the shrine candles has gone out. The one remaining candle casts crazy shadows over the chessboard, each piece with its own dancing outline."
    "Seeing all the pieces together there for once, without a thimble for a knight, brings me some resolution, as if even though I've made a horrible mistake, it was all destined to happen anyway."
    "Bit my bit, my night vision returns. The shrine comes into focus, and the school issue table as well. I could probably follow the path back now. I'm about to turn when I see..."
    "Something."
    "No, it has to be a someone. My heartrate doubles in two seconds flat."
    "It could be no one good out here, no one natural. Appearing in the middle of the night..."
    "Aha. Somewhere I felt it. I knew it, I knew it beforehand, but this person is a her. Not just a her, it's her."
    takeru "Hikari!"
    "She frowns. Hidden in the woods, with only the candle for light, her figure is dark, but it's her. My intuition has never been this strong."
    takeru "Hikari! It's you!"
    hikari "I hung on."
    takeru "Hey! Hikari! I'm coming over there."
    hikari "Stay. I don't really... You're very vague, whoever you are."
    takeru "I'm Takeru. I know you said that - "
    hikari "I didn't give up. I was robbed in my time here, and... I know there was something here that I wanted to do, but the fog, I - "
    hikari "You're Takeru."
    takeru "Right!"
    "She's off in the trees. I race off the path, but I can't seem to reach her."
    hikari "I'll be back. Count on it."
    "My foot catches an exposed root, and the air vacates my lungs as I slam into the ground. It's nothing. I rise to my feet, panting, but there's no one there. All I can see is the pinprick of a candle ten feet behind me."
    "It doesn't matter though. I'm still giddy. I know she's back."
    "Hikari is back."
    "There are second chances, and Hikari is back."

    "The field, though, is crowded. Every seat is filled with visitors from Mirako, and it looks like the entire student body is camped on the grass. We enter with the last stragglers as the principal takes the stage and starts delivering a speech."
    mana "Where were we set up again?"
    takeru "Don't look at me, I was only there ten minutes. Look for Meiko or Kenta or someone."
    hagami "There?"
    takeru "Good eyes."
    takeru "Hey! Natsumi!"
    natsumi "Yo, Kenta, they're back!"
    natsumi "Hey Takeru."
    kenta "Quiet down, will you? The principal is speaking."
    natsumi "Who cares? Two minutes until the fireworks start!"
    "The whole place is buzzing, despite the principal's slow, halting words about Mirako values or something over the loudspeaker. None of the groups around us are paying any attention to him at all."
    "There's only one problem -- Kenta and Natsumi are here, but..."
    takeru "Have either of you seen Meiko?"
    kenta "Not me."
    natsumi "She was here a few minutes ago. Did she slip off? She said she had to give a speech but everyone knows that we're going to have the fireworks show instead of the student council talking at us. See, the game is up!"
    "She points to the side of the field where two men in Fujiworks hardhats are walking out to a dark shape by the treeline."
    natsumi "They've been setting up! People are starting to catch on, and the principal keeps hinting about it."
    takeru "Did you see where she went? Kenta?"
    kenta "If she was giving a speech, she'd be going towards the stage, obviously."
    takeru "She's not - "
    takeru "Never mind. Hikari, you haven't seen - "
    hikari "Hang on."
    "Her eyes are fixed on the sky. It looks like the principal is finally done speaking, and there's cheering from the assembled students."
    hikari "Any minute..."
    mana "Are they starting yet? When do they start?"
    "A tech comes out from behind stage to grab the mic, and orchestral music replaces the principal over the loudspeakers."
    "Everyone has their head craned upwards, now. Everyone but me. I do my best to scan the crowd from our spot on the blanket, but it's fully dark by now, and if she's backstage, I wouldn't be able to spot Meiko at all."
    "I'm distracted by a low pop."
    mana "There - "
    "Then a boom echoes around the valley, a flash lights the air, and a white ring fills the sky."
    natsumi "Woohoo!"
    mana "First one!"
    hikari "Finally..."
    "Four spheres of blues and purples follow the white ring, and then concentric red stars."
    "Along with the rest of the audience, Mana, Hikari, Kenta, and Natsumi cheer in front of me. Another flash throws their outlines into contrasts with the illuminate sky."
    "And still, I'm back here try to use the momentary light to pick up faces in the crowd. Did Meiko bail out? Was she really heading for the stage? Could she have gotten lost on her way back?"
    mana "Look! Wow, Kenta, did you see that?"
    hikari "Beautiful..."
    "I try to shake it off and just enjoy the show with everyone else. The next firework hangs in the air, hisses and crackles, then fades in a glow of orange streamers. There's more applause, and my friends in front of me join in, so why..."
    "I feel out of place. Why is that?"
    "Like there's someplace I should be that isn't here. Between the flashes, I duck start walking away from the stage, towards Mirako. I crouch down to try not to get in the way of the rows and rows of students I pass, and finally I'm on the path."
    "I'm grateful for the crackling and booming overhead. With each explosion, the valley reverberates and the sky lights up, letting me see my way. I just the flashes didn't ruin my night vision completely... When the fireworks are slient, the path is dark."
    "It's not too far from here to my destination, if I could only see properly. Three white diamonds burst and flash in the sky, and I jump over a root at the last minute..."
    "...only to hit a rock and fall flat on my face. I grunt."
    "Somewhere, footsteps. A blue sphere crackles overhead, and in the brief light, I see a shape, moving towards me."
    meiko "Takeru?"
    takeru "Ow."
    meiko "Here."
    "She lends me a hand, and I rise and dust myself off. We both turn around a moment to face the fireworks."
    meiko "What are you doing out here?"
    takeru "I was coming to ask you that."
    meiko "If you knew this is where I was... then you already knew the answer, didn't you?"
    takeru "It was a guess."
    "The shrine is only a few feet away. With a lull in the fireworks, the two candles framing the chessboard are the only light. I follow Meiko as she walks over."
    "There's silence for a few seconds until four star-shaped bursts go up, all white, then another row of yellow. With each boom, the mountains beyond Mirako are illuminated by the explosion in the sky. The echo isn't only from the school behind us, but from the whole valley."
    meiko "She would've loved this."
    takeru "I'm sure Hikari's watching from somewhere."
    meiko "You sound so confident about it that... I guess that's what I'll believe too."
    "Another firework goes off, this one in the shape of a diamond latticed with lingering bursts of red and white. Hikari's shrine stands in relief."
    meiko "Here."
    takeru "What is this?"
    meiko "It's a sparkler. They were her favorite. Has it really been year, that I was standing right here with her?"
    "Meiko lights my sparkler, and I stare at the center until it burns into my eyes. In the background, the music from the stage speakers continues, muffled, punctuated by the bursts overhead."
    meiko "You can go back and watch with everyone else if you like. I'd feel terrible if you missed the fireworks just to check on me."
    takeru "I can see them fine from here, anyway. Why don't you come back and watch the show with the rest of us?"
    meiko "I'd rather no one see me like this."
    "I don't see anything wrong with her. There's a smile on her face, but Meiko's head hangs low and her eyes are closed, but... No, that really isn't like the Meiko she always tries to present, head high, shoulders straight."
    "Our sparklers go out, and she looks up."
    meiko "It's very strange to me, Takeru, how you seem to know her so well when everyone else here is trying so hard to forget."
    takeru "It's..."
    meiko "You don't need to say anything. Because you're right, I know it, she must be watching. I'm happy that, well..."
    meiko "I don't know. I'm happy because I think I made the right call, or at least you and I made the right call. There's not a day that goes by that I don't miss Hikari, but I think the fireworks are so much better than any eulogy I could hope to give."
    "In another burst of momentary light, I see she's turned to face me."
    meiko "You're really going to watch the whole thing from here?"
    takeru "If you're not coming back, I don't really have a choice."
    "Meiko laughs and pushes back her hair."
    meiko "Careful. You know that legend that Natsumi's always going on about."
    takeru "Screw Natsumi."
    meiko "Agreed., but..."
    meiko "I'll come back then. Or we could watch from here."
    takeru "It really doesn't matter to me."
    "...Except it does. Back at the field, with Kenta and Natsumi cheering, and everyone elbow to elbow watching the sky, or out here, Meiko and me, with the sound muffled but still with a perfect view above the trees?"
    "Somewhere in the distance, there's a boom, and yellow streamers light up the night air."
    takeru "Then we'll stay."
    meiko "That's playing with fire. If we watch from back here I might do something stupid. Let's head back."
    takeru "If you really want..."
    "Oh well. I take a step down the path when I feel a hand on my arm, holding me back."
    meiko "I changed my mind then."
    "There's a flash, and I catch something strange in her eyes, but then the light is gone. And in the dark, I don't see her, but I feel her, her chest against mine, her arms around my back. Meiko? Her head rests on my shoulder."
    "There's a moment I hug her back in dazed giddiness, but then that's all replaced with an acute panic. We take a step back, and with another crash above us, her face is lit up in front of me. Meiko looks just as confused as me, and about as red in the face as I've ever seen her. She's pretty much the same height as me, so we're eye to eye."
    "Meiko takes another few steps backwards and then starts talking in a jumble."
    meiko "I'm sorry about that, um, but I did say I was going to do something a bit ill-advised, but, um, I think I had the order on this all mixed up..."
    takeru "That's fine. I don't know if - "
    meiko "Um, hang on, if you'll listen for a minute... I did have something prepared for this, I swear. Just, in the moment..."
    meiko "Alright."
    "She takes a few breaths, and in the moment, my mind bouncing up and down between my head and chest at a hundred miles per hour. It's fast, out of control, and I don't have a rational response but to stand there with my heart working at double speed."
    meiko "Ahem. Takeru, I think it must've been yesterday, or, um a couple days before that, but..."
    meiko "Dammit. I did try to practice this, you know, so don't judge too harshly."
    meiko "Anyway, I finally realized why I was so focused on sabotaging you when you first came here. I thought it must've been because you know what I'm really like, or that I never forgave you for running away when you left for Tohoku... I wondered, I wondered and wondered at first."
    meiko "When we were growing up, it was you with your baseball dream, and me just confused and wandering. Then, you show up here, after all these years, and you're lost, and everyone thinks I'm the one with my whole life planned out and these ambitions I'm working towards..."
    meiko "So when you came here, and you knew no one, didn't know what to do with yourself... I felt that. That was me! And it sort of still is. I couldn't stand that we were so similar, or that I... That's why I kept making things difficult for you."
    meiko "And that, um..."
    meiko "I had a huge crush on you in middle school. You had to have known that."
    "Another series of crashes and flashes and lights overhead. I don't know what I expected to see on her face, but she's wearing that serene smile."
    takeru "I guessed, but... I didn't really think about you that much back then. I was an idiot kid, and - "
    meiko "That's fine. You were the big baseball star, so of course you didn't notice me. I'm sure there were a thousand other girls that felt the way I did."
    meiko "No, what got me was that when you showed back up, after I spent years trying to become someone else to spite you, that... I still felt the same way. I still do!"
    meiko "Can you imagine that? I'm supposed to be the enforcer on the student council, the class rep, on the fast track to a good school in Tokyo, and as soon as my old crush comes back, it's like I'm in middle school again."
    meiko "I hated you for that. Hated you! Enough that I was so petty to you, and I signed you up for all this work, when..."
    meiko "I'm sorry, I've gotten way off script."
    "Three blue spheres shoot up and linger, hanging in the air and cascading down in a shower of sparks."
    "Come on, Takeru, speak up. This is where I should say something but I feel like I've just lost about 50 IQ points."
    takeru "Er..."
    takeru "Thanks."
    meiko "What?"
    takeru "When you got me to help with the festival work, or put me into all those study sessions, I don't think that was mean of you. Er, even if you were trying to sabotage me or something, that's fine."
    takeru "I didn't know anyone at Mirako and just seeing a familiar face every day was a huge help. Sometimes I still feel out of place here, but if it weren't for you I think I'd be watching the fireworks alone right now."
    takeru "It was a huge comfort that I had you, and that you knew what you were doing. So... thanks."
    "Right. Isn't there something more I need to say? Just now, from Meiko, that was some sort of confession of feelings, wasn't it? I didn't completely miss her intent?"
    "Okay, think. What exactly do I think of Meiko? A friend, right. No. Do I have romantic feelings for her or not? I hadn't really considered it, but... That'd all make sense. Dammit. I wish the world would stop spinning all over the place so I could actually think straight."
    meiko "I'm really sorry about any trouble I caused with that, Takeru, but... I don't really know what I'm doing either. Don't you get it?"
    meiko "All this council stuff, the study sessions... What I'm saying is, I'm just as lost as you were, and you're the only person in the world that I feel like I can say that to."
    takeru "I hate to break this to you but I have no clue what I'm doing and mostly I'm not any less lost or aimless than I was on day one. Meeting you all has been great, but in the long run..."
    meiko "That's what I'm saying."
    "Another burst lights up her face. Meiko seems calm now, and she's still beaming ear to ear."
    meiko "Let's do this together. Your first day here, that's what I saw, that... That we were in the same boat, this whole time. Um, what I guess I'm trying to say is, is that I really like you, and I want to figure the future out together, you and me. What do you say?"
    "Meiko puts out her arm as if to shake hands."
    "And I'm left standing there the fireworks, staring like an idiot, paralyzed by my own stupidity. If anyone is supposed to know how I'm supposed to feel, it should be me, right? I'm pretty sure my IQ has bottomed out by this point and I'm just braindead."
    "Meiko has been a guardian to me, sometimes, usually just a friend, and then most recently, a source of confusion and that weird deja vu that she must be thinking what I'm thinking."
    "I think what that must be is a sense of undersatnding. It's the perspective I didn't have back then, and I could've never gained without meeting her a second time. This is a second chance. Even if I can't figure out what the hell is going on in my own head, I have to go for it."
    takeru "I'll take you up on that one. If you're willing to bear with me. I know I'm a bit of an idiot, but... I don't regret any of the time I've spent with you and I couldn't ask for a better friend."
    "I take her hand, and Meiko laughs and starts talking in a rush."
    meiko "Don't worry if you think you're not, um, well, what I'm trying to say is, that, I couldn't even get the order right, so - "
    takeru "Doesn't matter."
    "I don't know if she's mumbling or I'm just too jittery to parse it, but either way, I just embrace her again to shut her up."
    "Now the only sound is the quiet music from the stage and occassional boom overhead. There's a series of diamonds lighting up the sky, first a row of white, then red, the blue. The finale must be coming soon."
    "Meiko watches next to me. My old friend Meiko. Well, more than a friend now. As up above the sky flashes blue, purple, red white, speed building, she squeezes my hand. Maybe it was a handshake now it's me clinging to her, her clinging to me."
    "And with one last salvo, the orchestra stops. I realize there's nowhere I'd rather be than here."
    
    "I'm not sure how much time passes. Without the fireworks, the night is still. And dark. The shrine candles are the only light and I can barely make out Meiko's face next to mine."
    "For some reason we look at each other at the same time. I don't know what kind of face I'm making but Meiko immediately steps away and laughs."
    meiko "You would never believe that was planned."
    takeru "Er... No."
    "Although I guess that's not what she wanted to hear. Meiko stares for a moment."
    takeru "I mean, it was very romantic."
    meiko "Ah don't worry about it..."
    "But she's not looking at me."
    takeru "Should we go find Natsumi and the rest? Everyone will probably start heading this way before too long anyway."
    meiko "Maybe. Give me a few minutes. I can't let tonight go without..."
    "Meiko pulls something out of her pocket. The shape is unidentifiable until she brings it towards the shrine candlelight."
    takeru "Is that... That's the other green knight. Where did you..."
    "I stop talking and take a few steps back. After placing the knight on the chessboard with the rest of pieces, Meiko closes her eyes and looks up into the now empty night. It's been quite the evening, so I should give her some time alone with Hikari."
    "No sooner do I think the name then there's a whisper in my ear."
    hikari "Hello again."
    takeru "Hikari, holy - "
    hikari "Keep your voice down."
    takeru "How long have you been standing there listening in? Did you seriously... What are you doing here?"
    hikari "I caught most of that. It was very sweet."
    hikari "Oh get over yourself and wipe off that brainless grin."
    takeru "Sorry."
    hikari "There's probably only a couple minutes left, so listen carefully..."
    takeru "Until what?"
    hikari "Look at me. Do you notice anything strange?"
    "I try to look at her, but the most I catch in the near-dark is the glint of her eyes and a flutter of white hair."
    takeru "Where are you even?"
    hikari "I'm letting go."
    takeru "What?"
    hikari "I've done what I could. Today was amazing, but even Meiko is letting go, right now. No regrets, Takeru. That's what it's about."
    takeru "But..."
    hikari "What I want to say is... Look out for her."
    takeru "I'm not in a position to look after anyone. Meiko's twice the person I could hope to - "
    hikari "I think it's related, my leaving here and your showing up. I wondered where that knight had gotten to... Really, she was carrying it all this time..."
    hikari "I didn't mean to get sentimental on you Takeru, but I'm trying to pass the mantle to you."
    hikari "While I was alive, maybe I left some things unfinished, and I never got the ending I wanted. Tonight I've wrapped up some of my loose ends, but I'm passing the rest on to you."
    hikari "You have a responsiblitiy now."
    hikari "Look out for yourself. Look out for Meiko. I wanted some rose-tinted grand purpose in my life, but I was willing to settle for the fireworks. Don't let that out of your sight. You've got to try for... something perfect."
    takeru "Hikari!"
    "I half-shout, half-whisper her name into the night, but I can't spot her anywhere now. All I can hear is the glimmer of her voice in my mind. When I realize it's pointless to try to spot her, I stand still and try to listen, but I feel each second tick by until I'm sure Hikari is gone."
    takeru "Hikari, I think I get it, but, you've got to hold on, just a second, I'm sure..."
    hikari "Don't give up. I'm sure I'll be seeing you one of these days, so when we meet again... Don't let me down."
    "In silence, something flickers out."
    "In my blindness, it takes me a few seconds to realize the candles at the shrine a few yard behind me are no longer lit, and the darkness is total enough I can hardly make out my hand in front of me."
    "I'm busy staring at my hand when I almost run into her."
    takeru "Meiko?"
    meiko "Thanks for waiting. Hikari and I were very close and all, so... I thought I'd tell her the good news, and maybe after all this time she can get some rest. I'm sorry if that seemed strange."
    takeru "I've heard of stranger..."
    meiko "You can be very cryptic when you want to be. Did you know that?"
    takeru "Er, you can just ignore me. It's been a long day."
    meiko "For me, too, although..."
    "The only light is what filters down from the now cloudy sky, but I can still catch the outline of her face as Meiko smiles and takes a step closer."
    meiko "I can't remember being this happy for a long time. Even a bittersweet happiness, I'll take that tonight."
    takeru "I..."
    "Although I'm terrified I'm sounding like an idiot, Hikari's words start coming out of my mouth."
    takeru "I'll look out for you."
    meiko "No."
    meiko "We'll look out for each other."
